help
we
through
the
challenge
of
this

some
exasperating
some
exhilarating
and
some
comical
and
over
the
next
hour
we
be
go
to
go
through
all
of
they
start
with
the
best
and
worst
in
the
world
of
big
news
it
be
a
year
of
first
I
think
a
lot
of
people
who
predict
a
lot
of
thing
be
wrong
I
can
not
believe
it
be
the
end
of
the
year
already
it
be
be
weird
some
weird
stuff
happen
kind
of
horrifying
in
term
of
some
headline
the
worst
way
to
start
come
in
the
first
few
day
of
January
with
the
terror
attack
on
the
french
paper
Charlie
Hebdo
add
in
the
attack
on
Paris
later
and
indeed
around
the
world
and
you
get
the
worst
story
of
the
year
the
persistent
plague
of
terrorism
there
be
no
doubt
we
be
deal
here
with
a
very
different
beast
something
that
we
have
not
see
before
something
which
do
not
follow
any
form
of
normal
social
norm
or
even
even
by
the
perversion
of
terrorism
this
be
absolutely
out
of
the
pale
you
feel
hopeless
you
feel
scared
all
you
can
do
be
post
a
picture
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
inside
a
peace
sign
and
put
it
on
instagram
what
else
can
you
do
the
official
response
to
Isis
more
than
coalition
air
strike
since
they
begin
last
year
include
one
that
official
say
kill
the
infamous
Jihadi
John
and
the
best
personal
reaction
to
it
all
that
boy
that
Dad
vicious
assault
come
closer
to
home
Mass
shoot
something
rock
a
school
in
Oregon
a
planned
parenthood
clinic
in
Colorado
and
many
other
place
include
San
Bernardino
California
where
a
shooting
at
a
office
gathering
as
the
year
wind
down
reignite
fear
of
domestic
terrorism
any
time
you
hear
about
a
mass
shooting
whether
it
be
a
school
or
a
church
it
be
like
really
really
sad
it
go
to
show
you
that
sometimes
you
be
not
in
control
in
Charleston
South
Carolina
a
massacre
at
a
church
prayer
meeting
strike
many
people
very
hard
what
be
so
uplifting
and
amaze
actually
be
I
be
go
to
say
they
faith
in
action
that
congregation
afterward
amazing
grace
how
sweet
the
sound
most
graceful
move
in
the
aftermath
the
relatively
swift
move
by
South
Carolina
to
bow
to
pressure
and
take
the
rebel
flag
off
of
permanent
official
display
that
feel
like
one
of
those
like
problem
come
up
we
ban
it
it
be
over
with
and
as
a
society
it
feel
like
we
be
like
next
next
problem
not
exactly
this
year
the
worst
domestic
problem
that
seem
almost
unsolvable
racial
tension
we
be
hear
again
and
again
from
the
african-american
community
be
they
do
not
feel
as
if
they
be
be
treat
equally
or
with
the
respect
by
law
enforcement
as
everyone
else
in
Baltimore
the
death
of
a
black
man
in
police
custody
set
off
day
of
unrest
other
case
in
other
place
follow
many
of
they
shocking
and
poll
now
show
almost
half
of
all
Americans
think
race
be
a
big
problem
that
be
a
20-year
high
and
as
police
inquiry
mount
--
it
use
to
be
more
than
just
lay
people
off
suspend
without
pay
more
than
that
that
be
not
enough
because
they
need
to
be
make
a
example
out
of
they
need
to
fear
the
repercussion
of
treat
people
as
though
they
be
not
human
being
the
worst
backlash
police
officer
seemingly
be
target
shoot
at
and
in
some
case
kill
once
that
happen
I
be
so
afraid
because
if
everyone
be
rebel
against
the
police
then
who
be
go
to
protect
we
worst
case
of
try
too
hard
to
empathize
the
white
woman
in
Spokane
who
pass
herself
off
as
black
with
a
local
chapter
of
the
NAACP
I
identify
as
black
she
say
I
be
like
there
be
no
way
this
be
real
this
story
be
not
real
they
get
a
woman
to
pose
for
these
picture
this
be
crazy
best
way
to
cool
everyone
off
or
worst
depend
on
how
you
see
it
the
crush

most
friendliest
Reich

want
to
get
to

like
a
cool

it
be
interesting
to

afraid
and
I
get
fear

I
understand
the
panic

because
we
do
not
have
time
to
determine
who
be
a
real
refugee
and
who
be
pretend
to
be
a
refugee
so
they
can
infiltrate

that
be
what
we

be
kind
of
like
--

kind
of
all
about

the
political
scene
be
comically
chaotic
this
year
with
the
presidential
race
roaring
and
fight
aat
every
turn
and
a
democratic
proce
that
look
more
like
a
demolition
derby
no
one
slam
into
the
headline
harder
than
Donald
Trump
he
accelerate
into
the
race
with
explosive
pronouncement
about
mexican
immigrant
they
be
bring
drug
they
be
rapist
and
woman
we
want
to
breast
pump
in
front
of
I
and
I
may
have
say
that
be
disgusting
I
may
have
say
something
else
I
think
it
be
terrible
he
meet
every
challenger
head
on
even
as
pundit
predict
he
could
not
last
get
out
of
here
so
Donald
Trump
have
prove
those
of
we
who
think
we
know
something
about
politics
wrong
every
step
of
the
way
I
think
that
we
be
now
only
begin
to
appreciate
the
anger
and
the
passion
among
the
electorate
which
be
something
that
trump
have
be
able
to
tap
into
meanwhile
fact
checkers
and
comedian
go
wild
this
be
the
year
where
the
Saturday
night
live
skit
be
write
themselves
when
it
come
to
the
politics
they
write
themselves
they
do
not
have
my
talent
my
money
or
especially
my
good
look
unfortunately
the
way
we
elect
we
president
be
not
unlike
the
way
we
create
hit
tv
show
with
a
crowded
republican
field
some
voter
be
unimpressed
I
do
not
care
who
be
polling
better
right
now
we
have
many
month
to
go
it
be
go
to
be
a
very
long
process
I
will
tell
you
I
be
go
to
do
a
lot
of
research
before
that
happen
but
I
have
not
even
begin
there
be
just
too
many
people
in
the
playing
field
on
the
democratic
side
Hillary
Clinton
come
in
as
the
front-runner
and
stay
there
thank
you
so
much
even
though
some
in
she
party
rally
around
she
few
challenger
let
make
it
seem
like
we
have
a
lot
of
viable
people
but
the
former
secretary
of
state
still
have
problem
the
only
other
thing
I
can
really
think
of
be
Clinton
Benghazi
amid
persistent
question
about
the
Benghazi
attack
come
the
revelation
that
as
secretary
of
state
she
use
a
private
e-mail
server
in
she
home
to
conduct
government
business
she
try
to
laugh
it
off
hey
do
you
wipe
the
server
what
like
with
a
cloth
or
something
even
as
she
insist
she
do
nothing
wrong
poll
reveal
as
many
as
60
%
of
voter
do
not
trust
she
part
of
be
a
Clinton
it
seem
be
accept
that
there
be
people
out
there
who
will
never
trust
you
and
might
never
like
you
but
still
be
able
to
or
try
to
get
51
%
of
the
vote
strangely
enough
she
best
defense
come
from
a
challenger
Vermont
Bernie
Sanders
the
american
people
be
sick
and
tired
of
hear
about
you
damn
e-mail
Sanders
also
prove
resilient
enough
to
make
some
Democrats
believe
he
have
a
chance
despite
Clinton
big
league
Barack
Obama
do
not
nobody
know
who
he
be
so
if
he
can
do
it
anybody
can
do
it
I
be
not
surprise
at
all
with
so
many
voter
skeptical
of
the
political
process
and
just
plain
angry
the
biggest
trend
claim
outsider
status
Hillary
be
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
lady
Chris
Christie
be
like
well
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
republican
in
a
democratic
state
one
always
hesitate
to
criticize
or
to
comment
in
a
sense
on
a
political
process
when
the
people
be
be
give
the
right
to
speak
but
this
be
extraordinary
I
do
not
even
know
how
many
people
be
run
for
president
be
it
like
eight
I
have
no
idea
the
good
part
be
you
have
people
who
have
never
care
about
politics
in
they
life
that
actually
be
watch
this
and
they
care
and
they
be
talk
about
it
it
be
trend
as
the
kid
say
trend
least
effective
way
to
get
yourself
hear
in
Washington
because
you
might
just
be
shoot
down
fly
a
gyrocopter
to
the
Capitol
in
a
call
for
campaign
finance
reform
most
effective
way
to
get
hear
black
life
matter
the
group
confront
politician
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
scoring
headline
every
time
some
do
not
like
they
method
but
--
black
life
matter
by
and
large
have
be
the
most
peaceful
protest
when
compare
to
some
of
these
other
movement
if
you
catch
my
drift
worst
job
of
convincing
voter
they
be
listen
to
anyone
the
Congress
I
think
Congress
be
Darth
vader
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
Congress
can
do
to
make
itself
more
likeable
whether
it
be
a
democratic
congress
or
a
republican
Congress
it
be
just
one
of
those
word
that
Americans
seem
to
think
you
know
fingernail
on
a
chalkboard
right
now
even
the
speaker
of
the
House
step
down
ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH
Zipdy
YEA
my
oh
my
what
a
wonderful
day
John

so
happy
about

a
corner
stone
of

interest

go
up
the
way
many
people
want
people
do
not
feel
like

be
a
problem
compare

honest
to
God
answer

day
Hillary

we
still
the

also
face
question
after
the
number
two
house
Republican
say

of
the

the
movie
be
about
Sandra
I
be
try
to
be
respectful
it

a
backdrop
of
politics
but
it
be
really
about
how
far
be
it
okay
to
go
with
you
skill
you
talent
and
be
it
okay
to
destroy
people
life
if
you
be
be
pay
for
it
and
like
you
say
the
backdrop
be
politics

clearly
there

humorous
moment
and

incredibly
soft
bum
Anthony

smoother
butt
than
the
hair
I
have
grow
when
you
--
it
look

from

depend
on
on

we
want
to
make
sure
that
the

that
we
love
they

be
we

the
need
to

they
home
there
be
traffic
on

be
not

very
far
walk
but
there
be
traffic
and
we

I
be
Chris
Matthews
in
Washington
if
you
think
you
have
2016
figure
out
how
well
do
you
do
predict
2015
let
take
a
look
back
over
the
past
12
month
we
begin
with
the
Wlil
man
of
the
year
the
1938
be
Hitler
Stalin
the
next
year
it
be
not
about
nice
guy
finish
first
this
year
you
talk
about
the
man
that
rock
american
politics
it
have
to
be
trump
the
good
the
bad
and
ugly
he
dominate
with
the
tonnage
and
Sass
of
he
soar
mega
tower
we
know
about
he
what
can
we
get
from
it
be
it
plausible
that
a
majority
of
republican
delegate
next
summer
will
vote
for
this
guy
in
a
word
yes
my
colleague
a
special
round
table
with
the
global
editorial
director
of
Huffington
Post
Susan
Page
and
the
Washington
Post
columnist
Eugene
Robinson
we
begin
with
rocket
propellant
that
fuel
trump
rise
with
republican
voter
he
unrivalled
brand
of
nationalism
be
a
one-two
punch
they
be
bring
drug
they
be
bring
crime
they
be
rapist
I
would
build
a
great
wall
and
nobody
build
wall
better
than
I
every
time
Mexico
send
people
over
we
charge
Mexico
$
for
every
person
they
have
to
go
they
have
to
go
either
have
a
country
or
we
do
not
have
a
country
I
want
surveillance
of
certain
mosque
I
watch
when
the
world
trade
center
come
tumble
down
I
watch
in
Jersey
City
New
Jersey
where
thousand
and
thousand
of
people
be
cheer
Donald
Trump
be
call
for
a
total
and
complete
shut
down
of
Muslims
enter
the
United
States
until
we
country
representative
can
figure
out
what
the
hell
be
go
on
we
have
a
country
or
do
not
that
seem
to
be
the
common
thread
when
he
seem
to
have
break
through
the
membrane
of
what
would
be
unacceptable
when
he
say
we
keep
Muslims
from
get
into
the
country
that
explode
for
three
or
four
day
and
then
it
seem
to
mellow
down
a
bit
like
we
stop
talk
about
it
all
the
time
and
then
he
win
he
leave
a
flavor
of
I
be
the
toughest
guy
meet
what
happen
with
the
latest
example
be
the
same
thing
that
happen
with
the
previous
one
which
be
a
sense
of
go
too
far
this
be
a
bridge
too
far
this
will
have
a
reaction
it
do
not
apparently
hurt
he
support
in
the
poll
or
he
position
in
the
Republican
Party
if
anything
he
position
in
the
republican
electorate
seem
to
be
get
stronger
I
do
not
know
the
mathematical
algorithm
he
do
not
seem
to
pay
the
price
for
one
thing
it
be
all
part
of
this
I
be
as
tough
as
they
come
he
kind
of
create
he
own
reality
he
own
atmosphere
I
do
not
think
it
be
that
scientific
it
be
instinct
he
have
a
sense
of
what
he
supporter
will
respond
to
and
in
my
understanding
of
how
he
come
up
with
the
muslim
comment
it
be
he
it
be
strong
he
be
not
fight
it
out
between
Hillary
and
Bernie
I
think
he
listen
with
he
tongue
which
be
a
old
expression
he
talk
and
he
be
watch
the
crowd
react
to
every
syllable
you
get
it
and
the
other
guy
say
what
do
they
get
he
be
always
testing
that
be
because
he
be
a
master
salesman
that
be
what
he
do
in
New
York
he
be
sell
dream
and
soar
tower
how
be
he
pick
up
on
people
he
be
a
great
street
sale
person
and
he
seem
to
have
a
particular
sense
for
fear
for
when
people
be
weak
and
when
they
feel
afraid
he
can
use
that
to
attack
people
which
he
do
or
use
it
to
reassure
people
what
he
be
say
--
he
find
the
weakness
but
he
can
turn
that
around
because
he
understand
the
fear
among
voter
and
the
fact
be
voter
especially
Republicans
be
afraid
of
the
outsider
and
the
other
he
begin
with
the
birther
theme
in
2012
then
the
next
circle
now
the
next
circle
be
Muslims
and
again
every
time
he
do
it
within
he
orbit
it
work
I
think
most
man
when
we
be
afraid
whenever
we
get
afraid
we
get
mad
that
somebody
make
we
afraid
we
know
all
this
I
think
he
know
that
right
after
you
fear
you
go
damn
that
guy
for
make
I
afraid
I
think
he
--
anger
be
out
there
before
the
latest
terrorist
attack
there
be
just
generalize
anger
among
predominantly
white
college
educate
Republican
voter
and
he
have
capitalize
on
it
and
exploit
it
this
be
a
moment
that
fit
trump
not
every
election
year
would
be
a
good
moment
for
trump
this
be
a
time
when
a
lot
of
Americans
especially
work
class
american
have
see
stagnant
wages
for
a
decade
or
three
decade
a
time
when
people
be
concern
about
self-inspired
terrorist
people
be
mad
at
the
government
so
it
be
a
moment
that
fit
the
skill
and
they
be
mad
at
the
republican
establishment
like
the
president
say
this
year
when
he
say
can
not
do
much
about
lone
wolf
the
public
do
not
want
to
hear
about
that
Donald
trump
be
a
version
of
the
lone
wolf
he
be
the
lone
singular
personal
answer
he
be
say
I
be
the
simple
answer
what
be
you
phone
number
for
Donald
Trump
to
call
you
right
now
he
can
call
I
that
be
he
attitude
Trump
begin
by
question
the
president
birth
place
and
constitutional
legitimacy
he
ridicule
have
thrive
in
this
campaign
amen
we
have
a
problem
in
this
country
it
be
call
Muslims
we
know
we
current
president
be
one
you
know
he
be
not
even
a
american
we
be
look
at
that
and
plenty
other
thing
can
you
imagine
be
comfortable
if
a
muslim
become
president
of
the
United
States
some
people
say
it
already
happen
of
course
you
would
not
agree
with
that
radical
islamism
refuse
to
say
it
there
be
something
go
on
with
he
that
we
do
not
know
about
be
Donald
Trump
honest
when
he
say
that
Barack
Obama
be
not
a
legitimate
president
I
do
not
answer
it
because
if
I
do
answer
it
it
be
all
people
want
to
talk
about
you
will
have
to
answer
it
Catholics
believe
in
confession
you
say
you
be
wrong
and
move
on
you
believe
--
I
think
he
be
peel
ethically
I
think
it
be
whatever
it
be
Father
Matthews
you
do
a
good
job
of
try
to
get
he
to
the
confessionalism
why
will
not
he
drop
it
it
be
at
the
core
of
he
pitch
it
be
fear
of
the
other
fear
of
the
outsider
immigrant
who
will
take
away
you
job
the
secret
muslim
president
people
migrate
so
they
can
bomb
the
United
States
that
be
exactly
what
he
be
play
to
he
be
the
answer
he
be
a
birther
long
before
a
candidate
for
president
and
long
before
it
appear
to
anyone
that
he
could
be
a
candidate
for
president
I
ask
he
if
he
want
to
take
the
oath
for
office
be
this
a
level
of
bizarreness
be
he
assert
a
truth
what
be
he
say
the
fact
that
I
can
not
think
of
a
single
example
of
Donald
trump
correct
himself
or
acknowledge
something
that
be
part
of
he
appeal
I
think
there
be
supporter
who
say
of
course
he
be
wrong
I
like
the
fact
that
he
would
not
back
down
Teddy
Roosevelt
talk
about
speak
softly
but
carry
a
big
stick
this
guy
be
the
opposite

welcome
back
after
a
bruising
defeat
in
2008
Hillary
Clinton
be
back
in
the
presidential
arena
she
start
off
the
year
2015
in
the
same
position
she
will
end
it
as
the
democratic
party
front
runner
everything
in
between
be
not
so
good
for
the
former
secretary
of
state
New
York
Times
report
Hillary
use
a
personal
e-mail
account
at
the
State
Department
and
later
reveal
it
operate
under
a
private
server
here
be
she
response
when
I
get
to
work
as
secretary
of
state
I
opt
for
convenience
to
use
my
personal
e-mail
account
which
be
allow
by
the
State
Department
because
I
think
it
would
be
easier
to
carry
just
one
device
for
my
work
and
for
my
personal
e-mail
instead
of
two
look
back
it
would
have
be
better
if
I
have
simply
use
a
second
e-mail
account
and
carry
a
second
phone
but
at
the
time
this
do
not
seem
like
a
issue
the
scrutiny
over
e-mail
be
only
the
beginning
it
be
a
cruel
summer
as
she
face
a
relentless
press
corps
determine
to
find
out
whether
she
break
the
rule
or
mishandle
classified
material
be
all
ready
tell
I
something
I
do
not
know
I
have
say
repeatedly
I
want
the
e-mail
out
everything
i
do
be
permit
there
be
nothing
that
do
not
give
I
the
full
authority
to
decide
how
I
be
go
to
communicate
previous
secretary
of
state
have
say
the
same
thing
I
be
not
that
focus
on
my
e-mail
account
by
the
way
you
may
have
see
I
recently
launch
a
snap
chat
account
I
love
it
I
love
it
those
message
disappear
all
by
themselves
do
you
try
to
wipe
the
whole
server
I
have
no
idea
that
be
why
whee
turn
it
over
do
you
wipe
the
server
like
with
a
cloth
or
something
be
this
a
indication
that
this
issue
be
not
go
to
go
away
nobody
talk
to
I
about
it
other
than
you
guy
do
you
make
a
mistake
I
do
as
I
say
it
be
allow
and
there
be
no
hide
it
it
be
totally
above
board
everybody
in
the
government
I
communicate
with
that
be
a
lot
of
people
know
I
be
use
a
personal
e-mail
you
know
every
time
we
talk
about
Hillary
it
seem
like
she
be
a
ink
spot
and
you
tell
everybody
who
you
be
when
you
talk
about
she
these
conversation
go
on
and
on
be
there
anything
there
or
nothing
there
I
think
what
that
tell
you
be
that
she
lack
some
political
instinct
she
have
great
strength
as
a
candidate
the
progression
she
have
to
go
through
on
first
choose
to
use
a
private
e-mail
server
and
then
the
progression
try
to
explain
it
show
that
it
just
take
she
forever
to
get
to
the
place
where
she
should
have
start
which
be
this
be
a
mistake
we
will
make
it
right
who
be
in
the
room
with
she
we
know
there
be
a
Georgia
mafia
who
be
the
mafia
around
Hillary
Clinton
when
she
be
in
trouble
she
go
what
do
I
do
now
be
it
John
Papad
Esta
I
actually
think
if
there
be
one
conciliary
it
would
be
bill
be
that
the
way
we
can
report
it
that
she
know
phone
number
to
the
guy
and
when
something
hit
the
wall
and
she
go
how
do
I
get
out
of
this
one
he
call
he
as
he
do
with
she
when
he
get
in
trouble
except
for
some
certain
period
of
scandal
he
closest
and
most
trust
adviser
be
she
it
be
not
a
bad
thing
one
problem
Hillary
Clinton
have
be
there
be
not
one
room
with
adviser
she
have
a
whole
castle
full
of
room
with
so
many
adviser
what
be
the
down
side
voice
the
last
voice
hear
could
be
compelling
she
gather
literally
generation
of
adviser
around
she
now
there
be
no
question
that
Bill
Clinton
some
of
those
people
be
at
the
very
core
of
it
Bill
Clinton
be
number
one
there
be
question
about
what
kiepd
of
public
role
he
play
cht
how
much
he
campaign
and
how
visible
he
be
that
be
a
matter
of
tactic
in
term
of
who
at
the
end
of
the
day
she
talk
to
I
would
want
bill
Clinton
former
president
with
political
skill
Hillary
Clinton
fight
she
way
back
to
the
top
with
two
commanding
performance
in
October
everybody
agree
on
this
Hillary
Clinton
exceed
expectation
that
first
democratic
debate
here
she
be
take
on
Bernie
Sanders
on
the
issue
of
gun
be
Bernie
Sanders
tough
enough
on
gun
not
at
all
we
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
we
lose
90
people
a
day
from
gun
violence
this
have
go
on
too
long
and
it
be
time
the
entire
country
stand
up
against
the
NRA
the
majority
of
we
country
--
--
support
background
check
and
the
majority
of
gun
owner
do
Senator
Sanders
do
vote
five
time
against
the
Brady
Bill
since
it
be
pass
more
than
2
million
prohibit
purchase
have
be
prevent
a
few
day
later
she
sit
through
a
marathon
day
of
testimony
and
succeed
in
confront
GOP
lawmaker
probe
I
recognize
that
there
be
many
current
at
work
in
this
committee
but
I
can
only
hope
that
the
statesmanship
overcome
the
partisanship
at
some
point
we
have
to
do
this
it
be
deeply
unfortunate
that
something
as
serious
as
what
happen
in
Benghazi
could
ever
be
use
for
partisan
political
purpose
I
would
imagine
I
think
more
about
what
happen
than
all
of
you
put
together
I
think
it
be
compelling
testimony
the
back-to-back
clip
show
Hillary
at
she
strongest
as
a
political
figure
she
signal
to
Bernie
Sanders
you
want
to
fight
I
be
go
to
fight
I
be
here
I
be
here
so
she
get
the
right
angle
on
the
substance
of
the
gun
issue
it
be
also
a
issue
to
Bernie
that
I
think
be
hear
by
Bernie
that
be
number
one
on
this
other
thing
because
the
Benghazi
Committee
do
not
have
a
smoking
gun
in
term
of
a
e-mail
or
incident
that
they
could
draumatize
that
allow
Hillary
the
range
to
do
that
appeal
to
patriotism
and
bipartisanship
the
woe
be
I
those
back-to-back
thing
--
tell
I
something
I
do
not
know
about
Hillary
she
apparently
put
tabasco
sauce
on
everything
be
that
Arkansas
that
be
southern
certainly
that
can
make
she
the
second
black
president
a
good
idea
to
sprinkle
some
of
that
on
political
discourse
very
interesting
metaphor
we
know
she
be
a
brainiac
do
you
know
that
she
fail
the
dc
bar
in
the
summer
of
1973
the
group
that
take
the
bar
67
%
of
they
pass
that
get
to
something
interesting
about
it
although
she
be
a
brainiac
and
prepared
be
unstoppable
sometimes
she
do
not
prepare
she
do
not
talk
about
she
I
would
use
this
as
a
example
of
how
I
be
human
I
fail
and
get
back
up
she
come
across
as
so
smart
and
perfect
this
be
a
example
of
something
that
could
have
happen
to
a
lot
of
people
she
fail
she
bar
in
Iowa
in
2008
she
be
not
prepare
and
this
time
I
know
from
a
reporter
on
the
ground
we
have
a
great
reporter
who
say
Hillary
organization
in
Iowa
be
unbelievable
unbelievably
strong
Bernie
be
go
to
challenge
she
because
Bernie
have
the
progressive
in
term
of
organization
nobody
have
see
anything
like
it
on
the
democratic
side
the
doctor
be
in
look
at
the
rise
of
Ben
Carson
and
he
unconventional
candidacy
for
republican
nomination
this
be
hardball
the
place
for
politics
you
never
know
when
it
will
be
you
moment
to
shine
so
do
not
trust
you
smile
to
any
regular
toothpaste
improve
crest
3d
white
brilliance
remove
5
time
more
stain
than
the
red
box
try
the
whole
collection
for
a
smile
that
get
you
notice
welcome
back
to
hardball
Ben
Carson
be
one
of
the
more
confounding
candidate
a
world
famous
neurosurgeon
with
no
experience
in
politics
Carson
gain
popularity
in
the
tea
party
circle
for
he
attack
on
president
Obama
Obama
care
be
really
I
think
the
worst
thing
that
have
happen
in
this
nation
since
slavery
I
have
be
tell
that
he
say
we
be
live
in
a
gustapo
age
what
do
you
mean
by
that
very
much
like
Nazi
Germany
I
do
not
care
about
political
correctness
I
think
I
would
use
the
bully
pulpit
to
help
people
realize
what
we
have
in
common
what
have
be
use
for
be
to
create
war
a
war
on
woman
race
war
any
kind
of
anything
involve
people
of
two
different
race
you
think
be
gay
be
a
choice
absolutely
why
do
you
say
that
because
a
lot
of
people
who
go
into
prison
go
into
prison
straight
and
when
they
come
out
they
be
gay
go
so
far
as
to
compare
president
Obama
to
a
psych
opath
Obama
you
refer
to
he
as
a
psychopath
I
say
he
remind
I
of
a
psycho
path
how
they
tend
to
be
extremely
smooth
charming
people
who
can
tell
a
lie
to
you
face
Carson
tell
the
Washington
Post
heent
wotone
down
he
rhetoric
I
will
continue
to
say
what
I
normally
say
people
say
you
say
Nazi
dog
slavery
and
operating
on
a
very
immature
level
I
be
hope
to
get
to
a
place
where
people
be
mature
enough
to
think
I
do
not
like
the
analogy
but
I
like
what
he
be
try
to
say
we
be
back
let
I
start
with
Susan
this
just
smattering
of
crazy
talk
of
stuff
that
be
not
true
interesting
how
much
the
tone
you
use
effect
some
thing
be
as
outrageous
as
thing
that
donald
trump
have
say
but
say
it
with
a
mild
manner
they
come
across
in
a
mild
way
they
have
a
significant
support
from
evangelical
the
mood
be
darker
and
nastier
than
it
be
if
he
be
the
nicer
Donald
Trump
people
do
not
want
the
nicer
Donald
Trump
they
want
Donald
Trump
that
be
nice
to
know
Carson
have
be
criticize
for
foreign
policy
prescription
at
a
debate
he
lay
out
a
simpler
approach
to
destroy
isis
we
be
talk
about
global
jihaddest
and
they
desire
be
to
destroy
we
way
of
life
we
have
to
say
how
do
we
make
they
look
like
loser
I
think
we
have
to
destroy
they
caliphate
and
you
look
for
the
easiest
place
to
do
that
it
would
be
in
Iraq
and
outside
of
Iran
there
be
a
energy
fill
take
that
land
from
they
we
can
do
that
I
believe
fairly
easily
learn
from
talk
to
several
general
he
make
this
statement
about
the
chinese
that
send
fact
checkers
wild
we
must
recognize
it
be
a
complex
place
the
Chinese
be
there
as
well
as
the
Russians
you
have
all
kind
of
faction
there
I
think
that
be
one
place
the
Chinese
be
not
one
say
nobody
have
be
able
to
sit
down
and
have
he
get
one
iota
it
be
like
they
do
not
try
to
build
they
up
it
do
not
happen
and
it
do
not
take
we
see
he
support
go
way
up
he
be
lead
Donald
Trump
briefly
and
then
come
down
some
and
seem
to
be
head
in
that
direction
I
think
it
be
because
he
show
such
comprehensive
ignorance
about
foreign
policy
and
do
not
inspire
confidence
because
a
lot
of
what
he
say
even
casual
observer
realize
it
be
nonsense
he
off
tell
story
have
come
under
scrutiny
include
violent
episode
from
he
childhood
what
kind
of
outrageous
thing
be
you
question
on
that
be
probably
the
most
outrageous
I
accidently
put
a
gash
in
somebody
forehead
no
one
seem
more
confuse
by
the
political
dynamics
than
Carson
Republican
rival
Donald
Trump
if
you
try
to
hit
you
mother
over
the
head
with
a
hammer
you
poll
number
go
up
I
never
see
anything
like
it
this
be
a
strange
election
you
stab
somebody
and
the
newspaper
say
you
do
not
do
it
and
you
say
yes
I
do
I
do
it
no
you
do
not
yes
I
do
I
stab
he
and
it
hit
the
belt
they
say
you
do
not
do
it
if
they
say
I
do
not
do
it
I
would
be
so
happy
this
be
the
only
election
in
history
where
you
be
better
off
if
you
stab
somebody
cht
what
be
we
come
to
perhaps
nothing
Carson
have
say
have
be
mock
harder
than
he
statement
about
ancient
Egypt
my
own
personal
theory
be
that
Joseph
build
the
pyramid
in
order
to
store
grain
all
the
archeologist
think
they
be
make
for
the
pharaoh
graves
I
do
not
think
it
would
disappear
to
store
that
much
grain
that
be
tape
from
a
1998
speech
Carson
stand
by
those
view
do
you
still
believe
Joseph
build
the
pyramid
to
store
grain
it
be
a
plausible
explanation
I
happen
to
believe
a
lot
of
thing
you
may
not
believe
because
I
believe
in
the
Bible
Susan
you
have
to
do
this
one
the
pyramid
be
build
as
tomb
to
pharaoh
to
after
life
it
be
all
there
for
a
purpose
there
be
no
grain
in
there
that
be
you
theory
just
when
you
think
it
be
very
religious
and
about
the
after
life
Trump
have
defy
all
we
political
history
Carson
be
fit
have
a
surge
of
support
question
be
raise
he
do
not
do
a
good
job
answer
include
about
capability
to
be
commander
in
chief
in
this
way
it
be
familiar
like
a
series
of
the
2012
Republican
candidate
tell
I
something
about
Carson
we
do
not
know
he
say
some
really
controversial
thing
about
gun
that
everybody
should
have
gun
and
if
we
have
more
gun
fewer
shooting
he
be
a
good
marksman
in
high
school
he
be
in
rotc
and
score
high
mark
West
Point
material
well
--
maybe
maybe
not
that
be
you
theory
it
be
consistent
he
be
a
very
famous
doctor
I
know
he
long
before
I
hire
he
as
a
politician
and
he
do
not
believe
in
the
theory
of
evolution
he
say
human
be
too
complex
the
morality
of
the
human
race
be
too
much
to
think
it
evolve
from
something
else
all
those
thing
we
study
kingdom
of
animal
and
form
of
life
and
species
he
do
not
believe
in
any
of
that
which
be
very
widely

by
scientist

not

Donald

be
not
the
only
political
surprise
this
year
by
the
summer
of
2015
many
Democrats
be
feel
the
burn
as
Bernie
Sanders
campaign
draw
large
crowd
from
Portland
Oregon
to
Springfield
Mass
in
New
England
the
billionaire
class
must
be
tell
loudly
and
clearly
that
they
can
not
have
it
all
that
we
government
belong
to
all
of
we
not
just
a
handful
of
billionaire
Super
pack
fund
by
billionaire
buy
election
we
have
to
stop
worship
people
who
make
billion
and
billion
and
billion
of
dollar
it
be
not
acceptable
that
billionaire
family
be
able
to
leave
virtually
all
of
they
wealth
to
they
family
without
pay
a
reasonable
estate
tax
by
September
with
message
in
question
Sanders
outpol
Hillary
Clinton
43-36
just
a
few
week
later
one
line
in
the
first
democratic
debate
have
he
seem
more
friend
than
foe
to
Hillary
Clinton
let
I
say
something
that
may
not
be
great
politics
I
think
the
secretary
be
right
and
that
be
that
the
american
people
be
sick
and
tired
of
hear
about
you
damn
e-mail
I
too
you
know
one
of
the
debate
moment
that
will
be
remembered
and
perhaps
regret
by
he
I
think
that
--
I
know
I
be
a
political
type
everybody
know
that
I
think
you
have
to
look
like
you
be
fight
like
she
do
when
it
come
to
the
gun
issue
that
be
not
the
issue
that
separate
she
be
go
to
use
it
to
let
he
know
it
why
do
not
he
say
it
be
not
my
issue
but
it
be
go
to
cause
you
a
problem
and
get
elect
so
it
go
I
have
no
idea
must
be
principle
talk
about
issue
he
poll
have
go
down
since
then
the
poll
go
down
I
think
that
be
one
huge
reason
the
poll
start
go
down
look
like
he
be
not
go
to
fight
for
the
nomination
or
fight
she
for
the
nomination
the
other
I
think
really
important
moment
be
when
Larry
David
play
he
on
Saturday
night
live
rr
because
it
do
something
to
the
campaign
and
characterize
the
campaign
caricatureize
we
be
doom
we
need
a
revolution
million
of
people
on
the
street
and
we
get
to
do
something
and
we
get
to
do
it
now
I
think
you
be
right
I
think
Larry
David
do
Bernie
Sanders
better
than
Bernie
Sanders
do
and
not
to
the
benefit
of
Bernie
Sanders
I
think
Bernie
be
a
fighter
I
think
if
he
be
go
to
fight
he
have
to
take
the
case
to
Hillary
Clinton
all
the
way
along
I
know
why
he
do
not
do
it
he
brand
be
I
be
above
normal
politics
of
course
the
paradox
be
if
you
want
to
win
you
have
to
get
in
normal
politics
Bernie
refusal
to
do
that
doomed
he
what
will
happen
to
he
issue
some
of
it
seep
into
the
rest
of
the
democratic
party
I
think
he
have
have
a
influence
on
this
campaign
I
think
in
reality
have
help
move
Hillary
Clinton
to
the
left
although
not
so
far
to
the
left
that
she
can
not
get
back
to
the
right
in
the
general
election
I
think
there
be
a
lasting
influence
I
think
he
be
lose
the
battle
to
get
the
nomination
in
many
way
he
win
the
war
to
change
what
the
democratic
party
be
go
to
stand
for
it
have
demonstrate
the
energy
of
this
party
be
more
progressive
than
Hillary
Clinton
would
have
predict
Democrats
do
not
--
when
it
come
to
certain
figure
they
do
not
dislike
people
that
do
not
make
it
they
like
they
there
be
a
real
popularity
--
First
of
all
I
I
think
there
be
a
chance
that
Bernie
could
pull
off
a
upset
in
Iowa
I
think
the
more
important
point
be
continue
conversation
that
this
with
the
left
and
the
democratic
party
be
not
have
end
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
she
have
Bernie
to
deal
with
and
Elizabeth
Warren
the
conversation
and
pressure
will
continue
because
of
the
way
the
wages
have
stiffen
up
tell
I
something
I
do
not
know
about
Bernie
he
be
not
a
nice
guy
he
look
like
--
he
be
angry
and
like
you
lovable
uncle
he
be
not
a
lovable
fellow
he
be
a
prickly
guy
he
believe
deeply
in
himself
and
do
not
suffer
fool
at
all
anything
else
we
all
know
he
be
not
a
democrat
he
never
belong
to
a
party
except
one
something
call
Liberty
Union
Party
round
table
be
stick
with
we
the
man
who
lead
the

crusade
waupt
to
be

Ted
Cruz

as
a
outsider

might
have
the
inside

be
hardball

pick

choose

today
we
be
back
with
Howard
Susan
Eugene
despite
be
a
sit
senator
Ted
Cruz
emerge
as
a
formidable
candidate
the
break
through
moment
of
he
campaign
come
in
October
when
he
slam
the
media
at
the
third
presidential
debate
the
question
that
have
be
ask
so
far
in
this
debate
illustrate
whooit
american
people
do
not
trust
the
media
and
you
look
at
the
question
Donald
Trump
be
you
a
comic
book
villain
Ben
Carson
can
you
do
math
John
Kasich
will
you
insult
two
people
over
here
Marco
Rubio
why
do
not
you
resign
Jeb
Bush
why
have
you
number
fall
how
about
talk
about
the
substantive
issue
people
care
about
well
as
a
freshman
senator
elect
from
Texas
in
2012
Ted
Cruz
establish
himself
as
a
anti-washington
demagogue
in
the
mode
of
Joseph
McCarthy
when
he
explicitly
suggest
the
secretary
of
defense
nominee
Chuck
Hagel
might
have
take
money
from
North
Korea
I
will
point
out
that
right
now
this
committee
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
personal
compensation
Chuck
Hagel
receive
in
2008
2009
or
2010
it
be
at
a
minimum
relevant
to
know
if
that
$
that
he
deposit
in
he
bank
account
come
directly
from
Saudi
Arabia
come
directly
from
North
Korea
and
I
have
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
there
be
or
be
not
as
a
social
conservative
Cruz
have
play
he
card
well
in
the
crucial
state
of
Iowa
but
he
make
national
news
when
it
come
to
make
birth
control
accessible
to
woman
here
how
he
criticize
the
Democrats
charge
that
republican
be
wage
a
war
on
woman
when
it
come
to
contraceptive
Jiminy
cricket
this
be
a
made-up
nonsense
example
last
I
check
we
do
not
have
a
rubber
shortage
in
America
but
look
when
I
be
in
college
we
have
a
machine
in
the
bathroom
you
put
50
cent
in
and
voila
you
know
I
do
not
know
sometimes
TMI
Trump
talk
about
he
belt
a
knife
go
around
it
and
this
guy
do
we
need
to
know
about
he
rubber
machine
you
be
go
to
need
to
know
about
he
because
I
think
in
the
year
2015
besides
donald
trump
the
person
who
advance
the
most
politically
give
where
he
start
be
that
guy
Ted
Cruz
he
be
position
to
be
the
beneficiary
of
any
problem
that
happen
with
Donald
Trump
he
be
as
you
say
he
be
organize
in
Iowa
in
a
way
no
republican
ever
have
be
they
have
rent
dozen
of
apartment
in
Iowa
so
that
they
volunteer
can
have
place
to
be
when
the
caucus
be
come
along
to
organize
the
organization
he
be
do
the
focus
he
be
do
the
shameless
exploitation
that
he
be
carry
out
have
put
he
in
a
strong
position
well
he
brand
of
partisan
demagoguery
be
on
full
display
after
the
planned
parenthood
shooting
in
November
when
Cruz
tell
radio
host
Hugh
Hewitt
that
most
crime
in
this
country
be
commit
by
Democrats
you
know
every
time
you
have
some
sort
of
violent
crime
or
mass
killing
you
can
almost
see
the
media
salivate
hope
hope
desperately
that
the
murderer
happen
to
be
a
republican
so
they
can
use
it
to
try
to
paint
they
political
enemy
now
listen
here
be
the
simple
and
undeniable
fact
the
overwhelming
majority
of
violent
criminal
be
Democrats
the
media
do
not
report
that
no
I
guess
we
be
guilty
of
that
baby
I
mean
I
do
not
think
I
have
ever
do
that
calibration
you
thought
about
this
it
be
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
I
do
not
know
where
he
get
that
from
how
many
people
think
we
might
end
up
with
a
cruz-trump
fight
I
think
it
be
quite
possible
I
think
it
be
the
most
likely
final
outcome
big
fight
--
across
the
south
that
be
why
I
say
in
this
year
he
be
advance
from
nowhere
more
than
anyone
I
think
trump
travel
better
than
expect
down
south
I
think
it
be
more
homogeneous
than
we
think
the
southern
voter
might
like
he
style
come
up
in
the
year
of
voter
frustration

the
brash

many
Republicans
have
pin
they
hope
of
stop
Donald
Trump
on
New
Jersey
governor
Chris
Christie
as
a
brash
and
outspoken
force
within
the
party
he
be
get
a
second
look
now
among
those
who
think
he
tough
guy
persona
can
actually
take
the
fight
to
trump
tell
I
something
you
do
not
know
about
this
guy
anyway
look
he
score
well
in
recent
debate
and
so
there
be
a
--
this
whole
muslim
controversy
Chris
Christie
appoint
a
muslim
as
a
state
judge
in
New
Jersey
and
defend
he
against
criticism
he
could
perhaps
be
a
louder
voice
I
think
in
this
republican
field
against
the
kind
of
anti-muslim
bigotry
we
have
see
that
be
good
if
you
be
think
about
something
you
may
not
know
about
Chris
Christie
you
get
a
two
for
one
if
he
get
elect
he
be
class
president
at
the
University
of
Delaware
he
successor
be
he
wife
Chris
Christie
be
the
liberal
in
the
race
you
be
look
at
the
liberal
and
I
think
that
be
a
remarkable
thing
the
fact
the
big
newspaper
in
New
Hampshire
endorse
he
they
pick
he
out
not
so
much
because
of
ideology
but
because
they
think
he
have
experience
as
a
real
governor
and
also
that
he
could
take
on
Donald
Trump
but
I
think
he
be
reluctant
to
do
it
I
have
not
see
Chris
Christie
really
get
in
there
and
do
it
and
I
actually
do
not
think
he
be
go
to
because
he
would
like
to
get
on
the
ticket
you
think
he
might
be
a
bridge
to
the
20th
century
Republican
Party
I
do
not
know
not
that
bridge
thank

probably
slack
off
a
little
or
at

in
the
last
few
week
with
the
Christmas
tree
and
thing
like
that
what
be
the
best
way
to
get
start
or
recommit
yourself
if
this
be
what
you
be
look
for
in
2016
the
first
thing
you
want
to
do
a
simple
exercise
regular
push-up
situp
thing
like
that
I
will
show
you
some
variation
later
on
but
we
have
to
push
away
from
the
table
cupcake
dingdong
get
to
push
those
away
be
you
sure
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
at
least
four
a
while
you
can
have
you
cheat
day
and
thing
like
that
what
I
want
you
to
do
be
eat
a
lot
of
fruit
and
vegetable
and
drink
honey
of
water
Stick
with
a
six
like
you
say
go
back
to
gym
class
when
you
be
a
kid
just
keep
it
simple
do
not
make
it
more
difficult
I
know
they
have
these
thing
with
crossfit
and
every
thing
--
everything
else
it
look
difficult
to
keep
it
simple
as
long
as
you
stay
consistent
then
you
will
be
okay
some
of
the
video
you
talk
about
crazy
thing
these
video
of
thing
you
do
part
of
you
workout
I
know
you
work
with
a
lot
of
athlete
conditioning
thing
like
that
when
you
be
ready
to
take
it
to
the
next
level
be
a
something
you
get
into
definitely
I
think
the
best
training
be
performance
training
you
improve
you
balance
coordination
flexibility
then
you
will
move
better
and
the
weight
will
start
drop
out
I
be
not
a
weight
loss
person
I
teach
you
how
to
take
you
how
to
perform
better
and
it
start
to
happen
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
lot
of
equipment
to
do
the
stuff
he
bring
along
some
prop
what
be
something
basic
that
you
have
a
medicine
ball
or
other
weight
at
home
you
can
try
out
to
like
some
multus
-
joint
movement
that
basically
move
more
than
one
joint
do
not
do
curl
or
anything
like
that
do
thing
like
push-up
pull-up
full
squat
or
lunge
thing
like
that
they
help
you
a
lot
better
how
many
time
do
you
recommend
people
exercise
a
week
the
question
I
ask
you
question
I
will
ask
you
question
people
say
when
they
be
overweight
I
say
how
long
do
it
take
you
to
get
into
that
position
like
year
if
they
put
the
same
amount
go
back
the
other
direction
I
would
say
five
to
six
day
a
week
but
only
half
a
hour
a
day
you
do
not
need
to
do
two
or
three
hour
in
the
gym
up
to
a
half
hour-45
minute
a
day
that
be
it
talk
about
you
training
be
at
the
same
thing
as
high
intensity
training
you
read
about
that
hit
training
training
be
that
something
you
be
into
it
be
a
long
the
same
line
I
be
a
track
athlete
and
play
football
so
track
and
field
be
really
high
intensity
training
all
of
the
same
just
give
different
word
for
the
same
thing
that
the
performance
training
stuff
I
do
be
definitely
high
intensity
training
show
I

I

Angie
say
something
even
more
illuminating
as
a
eighth
grader
he
shovel
sidewalk

salvation
army
then
become
the
kind
of
Bellringer
who

hour
in

center
of

mr
--
any
be
try
to
celebrate
the
light
of
Jesus
Christ
well
he
leave
I
with
my
light
of
the
world
the
House
no
longer
empty
and
a
yard
aglow
in
heart
light
life
can
get
better
than
that
--
can
not
get
better
than
that
look
like
a
fabulous
display
there
be
great
light
around
here
I
have
take
a
couple
night
drive
around
a
little
bit
get
to
see
light
all
over
the
place
a
chocolate
Christmas
music
I
think
the
light
be
go
to
be
out
for
a
while
a
lot
of
people
be
hesitant
to
take
down
Christmas
decoration
when
it
turn
cold
and
it
be
turn
colder
but
the
muppet
and
60
why
take
they
down
at
30
let
look
at
how
thing
will
fair
through
the
overnight
we
will
hold
temperature
where
they
be
at
the
30
degree
mark
or
so
scatter
area
of
freezing
drizzle
flurry
as
well
keep
that
in
mind
not
see
any
major
problem
on
the
roadway
right
now
but
you
may
run
into
slick
spot
not
only
on
bridge
no
past
the
porsch
deck
step
cloudy
sky
go
to
eventually
low
temperature
to
fall
back
to
the
upper
20s
but
I
do
not
think
we
have
a
terribly
cold
tonight
scatter
flurry
patchy
freezing
drizzle
have
be
with
we
throughout
the
day
they
continue
as
they
go
overnight
and
most
likely
we
will
see
some
as
we
go
through
the
day
tomorrow
as
well
a
lot
of
moisture
in
the
air
really
the
cause
of
the
cloud
cover
we
have
have
temperature
now
in
the
upper
20s
low
30
wind
chill
in
the
team
back
and
low
20s
already
philly
like
January
hear
more
of
that
to
come
the
very
cold
air
continue
to
stay
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
United
States
and
in
Canada
best
early
next
week
there
be
indication
we
will
see
a
big
chunk
of
cold
air
break
off
of
Hudson
Bay
and
start
to
head
south
that
will
arrive
by
Sunday
night
into
Monday
linger
into
Tuesday
morning
we
will
get
into
cold
air
action
and
I
think
we
will
see
snow
shower
from
time
to
time
as
we
head
to
the
month
of
January
all
indication
point
to
that
right
now
we
be
not
go
to
see
a
lot
of
snow
out
of
the
lake
effect
unfortunately
or
fortunately
depend
on
which
way
you
look
at
it
I
we
will
have
scatter
white
or
be
the
continued
east
wind
disorganize
right
now
that
will
change
as
we
go
to
the
day
tomorrow
we
will
see
lake
affect
develop
likely
clip
into
northern
county
will
area
further
south
see
mostly
cloudy
sky
I
do
not
know
if
we
will
see
sunshine
tomorrow
just
too
much
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
temperature
tomorrow
will
likely
top
out
around
the
30
degree
mark
or
so
definitely
a
little
chilly
tomorrow
evening
thing
fading
back
to
the
20s
again
to
begin
the
day
Saturday
there
be
a
lake
effect
we
will
start
to

back
into
the

with
afternoon
as

begin
to

that
abate
but

Monday
wintry

hang
around

of

less
than
three

before

that

it
be
absolute
pandemonium
as

rush
to
get
out
of
the
building
amazingly
with
the
help
of
the
fiber
great
and
the
civil
defense
team
it
seem
everyone
be
evacuate
apart
from
one
person

honestly
I
think
this
be
a
film
the
wind
be
really
strong
all
week
really
especially
tonight
the
smoke
and
the
fire
go
to
the
whole
building
I
can
not
imagine
it
not
be
in
the
interior
after
little
more
than
a
hour
the
fire
subside
what
cause
it
be
not
clear
there
have
be
no
sign
so
far
it
be
deliver
despite
fear
around
the
world
of
possible
terrorist
attack
the
Dubai
authority
do
not
want
to
stop
the
party
at
midnight
the
celebration
go
ahead
it
will
not
need
a
firework
at
start
of

will
be
remember
for
but
a
massive
hotel
fire
which
miraculously
do
not
cause
or
injury
Bridget
Kendall
BBC
News
let
cross
over
live
to
Dubai
and
we
can
speak
to
Richard
Upshaw
a
entrepreneur
who
live
there
and
he
be
at
the
hotel
when
this
fire
break
out
he
join
we
via
webcam
Richard
you
have
a
incredibly
lucky
escape
tell
we
what
happen
to
you
we
be
on
the
sixth
floor
in
a
restaurant
and
it
be
the
same
side
that
be
engulf
with
flame
around
local
time
here
Eating
dinner
out
on
the
terrace
there
be
people
on
the
garden
about
three
story
below
we
who
start
point
above
we
head
and
we
could
maybe
see
risk
of
smoke
and
what
look
like
reflection
of
flame
or
something
and
because
it
be
new
year
eve
we
naturally
think
maybe
it
be
part
of
the
celebration
perhaps
a
precursor
to
the
firework
that
be
go
to
happen
directly
opposite
where
we
be
when
the
people
restore
the
lowest
start
scream
and
run
away
and
bit
of
debris
start
to
fall
initially
just
small
piece
they
obviously
realize
that
perhaps
thing
be
not
go
accord
to
plan
and
then
a
large
piece
of
debris
land
in
the
garden
and
basically
take
out
garden
furniture
in
flame
I
grab
a
hold
of
my
friend
and
say
we
be
go
we
fairly
calmly
walk
back
through
the
restaurant
where
people
be
dine
like
there
be
nothing
go
on
there
be
no
fire
alarm
no
fire
marshal
and
we
walk
through
the
restaurant
down
the
staircase
watch
a
guy
try
to
set
off
the
fire
alarm
which
do
not
appear
to
work
and
we
go
all
the
way
through
the
lobby
and
out
to
the
front
of
the
Valet
parking
area
of
the
hotel
do
not
return
it
to
have
a
look
behind
we
and
we
see
flame
lick
around
the
side
of
the
building
at
which
point
we
then
make
we
way
down
because
other
people
start
to
come
out
I
have
hear
about
pandemonium
I
would
say
he
be
maybe
towards
the
end
of
the
people
come
out
that
it
get
a
bit
more
raucous
it
be
fairly
control
but
there
be
a
distinct
absence
of
a
fire
marshal
or
anybody
really
tell
anybody
want
to
do
until
probably
a
few
minute
into
whatever
be
happen
as
we
come
around
the
side
of
the
hotel
we
could
blatantly
see
that
the
hotel
appear
to
be
on
fire
although
all
the
light
be
on
a
there
be
no
spring
close
and
action
and
it
do
appear
that
there
be
no
sprinkler
--
there
be
no
sparkler
in
action
and
it
be
find
by
the
light
breeze
flow
that
night
the
report
of
it
go
through
the
hotel
from
my
experience
and
what
I
see
seem
to
be
exaggerate
it
seem
to
be
on
the
outside
consume
all
of
the
furniture
and
the
awning
and
so
on
very
intense
but
not
particularly
long
and
indeed
some
of
the
footage
I
have
see
after
it
do
bear
that
out
it
be
adjust
that
you
make
the
point
that
it
be
on
the
outside
which
I
guess
would
explain
why
there
be
so
few
injury
give
the
intensity
of
the
flame
that
we
see
outside
the
building
yeah
the
intensity
of
what
I
have
see
on
video
and
what
we
see
in
person
you
be
absolutely
right
all
the
smoke
billow
off
the
building
be
come
off
the
building
rather
than
out
of
the
building
in
Dubai
because
everything
be
largely
air-conditioned
window
and
slide
door
and
so
forth
tend
to
be
sure
I
think
this
contribute
to
the
fact
although
I
have
no
doubt
that
some
part
of
the
interior
be
affect
the
fire
do
come
under
control
fairly
quickly
within
a
hour
or
so
indeed
as
we
be
leave
the
downtown
area
which
we
decide
to
do
something
because
we
do
not
know
what
be
go
on
and
it
be
not
worth
the
risk
in
case
it
be
the
precursor
to
something
more
substantial
by
somebody
but
as
we
be
leave
a
little
over
a
hour
later
it
be
just
smoke
billow
up
the
side
of
the
building
Richard
you
say
there
be
a
act
of
a
fire
marshal
lack
of
information
but
overall
people
be
organize
in
the
way
they
evacuate
that
building
um
basically
could
what
help
be
the
fact
that
the
Dubai
authority
shut
all
the
road
down
in
the
area
of
people
could
still
quite
easily
get
out
of
the
hotel
and
down
the
major
ramp
once
we
ask
a
guy
out
in
the
street
there
be
police
and
security
usher
people
away
and
they
be
start
to
arrive
the
take
the
fire
quite
a
long
time
to
get
there
they
do
not
quite
seem
sure
where
to
go
or
how
to
tackle
the
issue
the
barricade
do
not
help
matter
either
I
do
feel
that
perhaps
if
I
have
a
bit
of
a
lucky
escape
and
the
fire
be
largely
on
the
outside
of
the
building
which
be
what
contribute
to
the
minimize
--
there
be
people
out
in
the
street
in
pajamas
dress
down
as
well
as
event
where
as
well
another
thing
be
that
that
particular
area
do
not
have
thousand
of
people
immediately
around
it
most
of
view
area
be
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
go
away
from
the
hotel
and
I
do
think
that
everybody
have
have
a
lucky
escape
Richard
thank
you
so
much
for
share
you
lucky
escape
with
we
here
on
BBC

eve
special
it
be
certainly
be
a
wild
year
in
politics
the
2016
presidential
candidate
have
provide
plenty
of
fodder
for
comedian
to
poke
fun
at
which
hopeful
have
be
the
easiest
to
mock
well
how
about
Bernie
Sanders
now
if
you
do
not
mind
I
be
go
to
dial
it
right
up
to
a
10
go
right
ahead
we
be
doom
we
need
a
revolution
million
of
people
on
the
street
and
we
get
to
do
something
and
we
get
to
do
it
now
this
may
not
be
great
politics
but
I
think
the
american
people
be
sick
and
tired
about
hear
about
you
damn
email
thank
you
thank
you
berth
God
it
must
#
%
scream
and
cuss
in
public
I
think
that
be
a
instant
classic
I
think
he
nail
it
so
well
he
be
better
than
Bernie
Sanders
he
be
fantastic
I
would
be
very
worried
if
he
be
run
for
office
just
like
the
entertainment
factor
be
so
uge
he
be
a
very
funny
guy
I
love
do
you
think
he
look
like
Bernie
Sanders
the
problem
be
he
only
have
a
few
more
week
to
play
Bernie
Sanders
you
be
in
for
a
shock
always
the
vice
presidential
slot
you
never
know
I
want
to
hear
the
expert
opinion
do
you
think
it
be
good
happy
juanza
can
I
make
a
larger
point
about
these
parody
certainly
the
difference
between
like
a
conservative
and
a
liberal
predicate
on
a
really
distinct
difference
the
left
be
politically
skilled
but
inept
in
real
life
the
right
be
politically
inept
but
they
make
the
train
run
on
time
so
when
you
watch
Saturday
night
live
they
always
--
the
candidate
be
always
very
politically
skilled
but
we
be
the
dumby
we
make
everything
work
it
raise
the
question
who
would
you
rather
be
stick
on
a
desert
island
with
a
political
animal
or
a
useful
animal
Bernie
Sanders
or
Ben
Carson
everybody
would
say
Ben
Carson
that
explain
the
difference
in
satire
that
you
can
make
fun
of
the
useful
people
but
it
be
the
useless
people
the
political
people
that
you
embrace
be
careful
about
honor
people
who
make
the
train
run
on
time
that
be
what
I
be
say
history
have
not
be
kind
to
those
people
let
take
another
clip
Juan
here
be
Donald
Trump
interview
himself
on
the

the
truth
be
I
be
always

to
be
a
big
debate
but
I
be
always
ready
it
be
not
just
big
it
be
uge
Uge
Uge

I
think
Donald
Trump
with
the
it
be
go
to
be
great
so
great
uge
we
be
go
to
be
so
successful
you
be
go
to
get
tired
of
win

to
be
uge
you
have
to
laugh
when
you
see
Donald

I
how
about
tonight
when
he
ring
in
the
new
year
he
be
go
to
say
it
be
go
to
be
uge
Hillary
Clinton
meet
up
with
snl
a
political
candidate
who
sound
a
awful
lot
like
she
I
be
Hillary
Rodham
Clinton
hey
great
name
I
be
val
so
Hillary
what
bring
you
here
tonight
well
I
need
to
blow
off
some
steam
I
have
have
a
hard
couple
of
22
year
oh
I
get
it
you
be
a
politician
yes
yes
and
how
about
you
well
I
I
be
just
a
ordinary
citizen
who
believe
the
keystone
pipeline
will
destroy
we
environment
I
agree
with
you
there
it
do
take
I
a
long
time
to
decide
that
but
I
be
against
it
I
just
realize
I
never
check
you
id
come
on
please
I
have
a
1-year-old
granddaughter
she
call
I
Madam
President
so
Dana
I
know
that
you
think
oftentimes
snl
be
unfair
to
Republican
can
cat
what
do
you
think
they
be
do
do
to
Hillary
Clinton
help
she
out
if
you
look
at
the
previous
clip
that
we
just
have
with
fallon
where
trump
be
do
the
mirror
image
of
himself
he
get
the
joke
of
himself
Hillary
be
point
out
the
flip-flop
the
fact
that
she
be
for
the
keystone
pipeline
before
she
be
against
it
so
many
of
those
it
be
not
sharp
it
be
almost
as
if
once
you
pass
the
SNL
test
it
be
all
smooth
over
then
be
you
never
have
to
revisit
that
unpleasantness
of
you
campaign
what
I
hear
you
say
in
my
ear
be
it
be
not
funny
I
do
not
think
it
be
funny
what
be
funny
about
crush
the
american
dream
and
destroy
job
good
point
it
be
not
funny
we
be
all
look
like
the
audience
laugh
because
there
be
some
sort
of
--
--
because
they
be
all
in
on
because
if
the
audience
laugh
even
if
it
be
not
funny
it
let
she
off
the
hook
look
like
we
be
about
to
get
away
with
I
you
think
it
be
funny
it
be
because
it
seem
like
such
a
plastic
hillary
talk
to
it
another
plastic
Hillary
and
they
be
both
in
on
the
fact
that
they
be
all
--
there
be
so
much
pretense
that
she
can
not
laugh
out
loud
he
she
can
not
curse
she
can
not
do
anything
out
loud
do
not
seem
like
the
perfect
couple
not
in
my
home
Ben
Carson
be
a
very
even-keeled
guy
of
he
be
not
a
yeller
as
you
know
he
do
not
scream
the
Saturday
night
live
Jay
Farrell
nail
he
impersonation
doctor
do
you
a
brain
surgeon
have
the
experience
and
toughness
to
deal
with
world
leader
like
Vladimir
Putin
that
question
make
I
furious
Wolf
I
might
go
ham
up
in
here
right
now
of
course
I
can
be
tough
as
a
surgeon
I
have
to
tell
people
thing
they
do
not
want
to
hear
not
that
they
have
to
have
brain
surgery
that
it
would
be
perform
by
I
a
man
who
they
believe
to
be
asleep
but
I
be
not
asleep
I
be
amp
I
be
jack
and
I
be
ready
to
throw
down
what
do
you
think
of
that
Putin
that
make
he
seem
so
weak
even
effeminate
and
that
be
just
not
Ben
Carson
I
be
guess
they
be
mock
he
I
be
not
sure
it
be
fair
I
like
mockery
where
can
you
say
I
get
the
joke
in
this
case
I
be
not
sure
I
get
the
joke
be
you
look
at
I
yeah
I
think
you
be
just
stare
at
I
I
think
you
be
right
they
go
the
wrong
direction
the
criticism
for
Ben
Carson
be
that
he
seem
kind
of
sleepy
and
he
be
very
low
--
very
relax
in
this
case
they
go
in
direction
that
if
you
be
a
conservative
humorist
do
it
to
a
liberal
you
would
be
force
to
apologize
right
they
act
like
yes
we
weird
low
energy
also
maybe
drink
or
effeminate
there
be
gay
alucien
in
that
I
do
not
catch
that
I
do
I
think
they
be
go
for
the
low
energy
quiet
tired
you
think
they
be
work
for
trump
that
be
a
label
trump
put
on
he
watch
it
again
all
right
I
have
a
tendency
you
get
the
point
here
you
be
judge
Kennedy
Justice
Kennedy
here
no
I
be
not
I
think
this
be
what
be
go
through
my
mind
I
guess
I
decide
as
a
republican
or
a
conservative
if
I
be
watch
Saturday
night
live
and
they
be
make
fun
of
one
of
my
people
that
be
not
funny
listen
to
the
audience
would
mostly
vote
Democrat
or
identify
as
liberal
think
think
it
be
Hillary
even
we
humor
have
become
politicize
somebody
like
Larry
David
can
make
we
laugh
maybe
it
be
the
quality
of
the
person
who
be
do
the
impersonation
Larry
David
do
Bernie
Sanders
be
funny
I
hope
Bernie
Sanders
think
that
be
funny

you

Kimberly

from

nonpolitical
story
have
mean
the
most
to
you
so
far
this
year
nonpolitical
nonpolitical
story
I
do
not
know
if
I
can
come
up
with
a
good
one
for
that
because
I
feel
lining
all
we
have
do
be
politics
you
talk
about
royalty
every
single
day
well
then
it
be
go
to
be
royal
baby
there
you
go
royal
baby
I
do
like
to
cover
that
in
my
one
more
thing
McDonald
breakfast
the
new
sausage
breakfast
burrito
that
be
nonpolitical
frivolous
but
delicious
story
exactly
there
you
go
I
like
the
story
because
mostly
it
poke
you
Unicorn
cage
that
be
true
it
do
bother
I
I
be
not
a
big
fan
of
royal
baby
unless
they
belong
to
George
Bret
Juan
I
would
say
the
pope
visit
I
know
some
people
would
say
it
be
political
I
take
it
as
a
nonpolitical
story
and
I
be
just
touch
there
be
moment
where
in
Washington
--
downtown
Washington
he
clog
the
street
the
secret
there
be
nobody
the
police
could
stop
it
people
love
the
pope
a
spiritual
connection
then
he
go
and
have
lunch
with
homeless
people
and
for
all
the
big
shot
it
be
like
well
why
be
he
not
visit
I
then
in
Philadelphia
he
go
to
a
jail
and
it
be
a
great
picture
a
lot
of
papers
of
he
hold
hand
with
a
guy
who
Tattoos
and
bruise
I
will
tell
you
it
make
I
emotional
all
right
I
disagree
with
you
it
be
political
go
ahead
be
black
life
matter
the
hand
up
do
not
shoot
be
that
political
yeah
it
be
how
about
hand
up
do
not
shoot
be
name
as
biggest
lie
of
the
year
false
narrative
and
Social
Story
do
not
matter
good
for
he
for
bring
it
up
Pinocchio
of
course
it
be
political
and
equivalent
would
be
Eric
garner
say
I
can
not
breathe
but
that
be
very
real
we
be
turn
this
into
a
political
segment
okay
I
be
go
to
say
the
story
that
keep
I
up
at
night
be
about
the
you
seed
in
particular
the
woman
who
be
be
attack
by
Isis
the
young
girl
and
woman
be
attack
and
be
hold
as
sex
slave
and
so
much
terrible
thing
be
happen
to
they
that
keep
I
up
at
night
I
guess
in
a
way
that
be
political
as
well
because
I
feel
like
we
have
not
fulfil
we
moral
obligation
to
help
they
what
do
you
think
be
the
most
important
story
nonpolitical
the
only
thing
I
could
think
of
like
you
what
bother
I
be
the
contrast
between
progress
and
regress
the
fact
that
like
--
we
be
get
iphone
computer
and
all
this
great
stuff
meanwhile
on
the
East
there
be
a
terrible
wind
come
this
way
of
a
group
of
people
who
want
to
destroy
all
of
that
there
be
a
group
that
want
to
go
back
in
time
while
we
go
forward
in
time
that
be
a
really
weird
story
it
be
like
--
maybe
we
be
the
anomaly
maybe
we
be
not
suppose
to
have
progress
that
be
what
I
be
think
all
right
I
hope
that
be
wrong
start
this
way
John
what
do
you
think
the
country
will
look
like
after
new
year
2016
happen
will
it
be
worse
or
better
Dana
like
a
in
tonight
at
midnight
what
do
I
think
I
be
a
optimistic
person
I
think
we
have
get
some
good
thing
on
the
horizon
election
year
be
exciting
I
do
think
there
be
cause
for
concern
about
the
economy
just
overall
not
try
to
make
this
political
but
just
the
stagnation
of
it
third
quarter
gross
domestic
product
be
revise
downward
to
2
%
that
be
be
not
good
enough
in
order
to
have
a
grow
economy
to
do
you
will
at
thing
we
want
to
do
whether
you
be
on
the
left
or
right
we
need
more
economic
growth
Eric
I
think
it
be
go
to
be
better
either
way
no
matter
hot
president
be
I
would
love
to
see
the
conservative
in
there
make
thing
a
lot
better
for
the
middle
class
and
if
you
do
not
have
a
conservative
you
have
a
Hillary
Clinton
it
will
be
better
than
Barack
Obama
it
will
be
the
economy
--
as
Dana
point
out
be
recover
and
the
next
four
or
eight
year
will
be
a
lot
better
for
the
middle
class
Juan
I
think
the
economy
be
do
--
I
be
a
little
bit
stunned
because
at
this
table
at
this
table
what
I
would
say
the
reason
the
Fed
have
to
raise
the
interest
rate
because
they
be
worry
about
--
--
they
do
not
have
to
Juan
they
do
not
have
to
they
be
say
the
economy
be
do
well
I
would
say
overall
you
know
what
I
love
America
I
you
think
the
country
be
do
very
well
I
do
not
want
the
evil
wind
come
from
the
east
speaking
of
wind
kimberly
that
be
you
what
I
think
of
the
country
I
think
it
be
go
to
be
great
year
in
2016
I
really
do
believe
this
I
think
we
be
go
to
make
a
amazing
choice
with
a
new
president
get
this
country
back
in
the
right
direction
we
be
go
to
crush
isis
the
economy
be
go
time
prove
I
be
very
bullish
about
2016
all
right
my
prediction
be
it
be
go
to
be
a
absolutely
horrible
year
and
thing
be
go
to
get
worse
and
worse
and
worse
and
there
be
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
because
that
be
the
way
it
be
it
be
go
to
go

not
have
any
life

it

go
to
be
in
the
upper
30
the
good
thing
be
what
would
make
it
feel
cooler
would
be
a
good
gust
of
Santa
Ana
wind
however
the
Santa
Ana
wind
will
be
on
both
side
of
the
San
Gabriel
Valley
but
not
in
Pasadena
so
they
will
just
be
cold
but
not
windy
and
cold
here
be
some
current
number
52
in
Valencia
61
downtown
first
thing
we
have
to
talk
about
be
wind
wind
be
diminish
all
of
the

all
the
mountain
area
the
valley
of
the
ie
Santa
Clarita
valley
drop
off
at
about
now
we
have
three
front
to
look
forward
to
we
will
start
the
new
year
in
a
great
day
first
Sunday
into
Monday
of
the
three
that
will
affect
we
weather
with
the
potential
for
measurable
rain
this
look
to
be
the
one
that
will
be
the
least
direct
hit
the
bulk
of
the
moisture
will
go
down
into
baja
we
will
still
get
some
measurable
rain
but
the
follow
two
the
second
will
happen
late
in
the
day
Tuesday
probably
to
in
the
afternoon
and
about
noon
on
Wednesday
the
3rd
those
two
be
slightly
more
of
a
direct
hit
let
get
a
look
at
the
wind
and
when
they
will
settle
wind
will
stay
20
or
more
mile
a
hour
offshore
northeast
to
southwest
right
through
the
news
tonight
for
the
start
of
the

tomorrow

sit
right
there
yes
in

end
of
the
Los
Angeles
County
mountain
but
completely
avoid
the
Pasadena
area
it
will
just
be
beautiful
with
great
visibility
and
then
after
probably
the
Rose
Bowl
in
the
afternoon
the
wind
will
say
good-bye
by
Saturday
morning
not
be
a
issue
anymore
here
be
what
to
look
at
for
storm
the
central

eastern
Pacific
be
really
juice
up
and
here
be
what
we
can
expect
first
storm

late
on
Sunday
into
Monday
morning
probably
in
the
overnight
area
but
you
can
see
the
bulk
of
the
moisture
seem
to
be
head
south
second
storm
probably
about
or
in
the
afternoon
on
Tuesday
a
slightly
more
direct
hit
third
storm
at
in
the
morning

maybe
noon
on

the
chance
to

definitely
stack
against
I
I
want
to
do
something
different
it
be
just
tough
since
its
day
as
a
battleground
in
the
American
Revolution
Boston
Massachusetts
have
become
know
as
the
city
of
neighborhood
with
deep-rooted
loyalty
run
through
its
diverse
community
but
when
certain
bostonian
take
territorial
pride
a
little
too
far
they
could
wind
up
in
the
Suffolk
County
jail
there
be
approximately
180
or
so
street
gang
within
Boston
just
neighborhood
street
gang
they
be
all
comprise
of
a
couple
of
block
sometimes
a
project
sometimes
a
entire
neighborhood
certainly
in
almost
every
case
every
group
have
some
sort
of
serious
feud
with
at
least
four
to
five
other
group
within
the
city
of
Boston
and
over
the
past
10
year
the
structure
of
those
gang
have
change
and
that
be
have
a
serious
impact
on
the
jail
such
as
it
be
there
be
a
bit
of
a
code
about
what
you
do
and
what
you
do
not
do
and
that
seem
to
have
go
by
the
wayside
and
what
that
translate
into
be
some
of
this
wild
west
mentality
and
sort
of
shooting
for
any
slight
real
or
imagine
that
be
just
how
it
be
a
bank
robber
rob
bank
a
nurse
help
patient
gang
member
shoot
each
other
back
to
the
-lsb-
bleep

22-year-old
Delshaun
Bloodworth
say
he
spend
much
of
the
last
ten
year
as
a
member
of
one
of
Boston
local
street
gang
as
I
get
older
I
really
like
the
lifestyle
I
like
the
lifestyle
it
be
easier
it
be
easier
than
just
show
up
to
work
every
day
see
the
same
people
even
though
you
do
not
like
they
mad
at
they
do
not
want
to
see
they
ever
again
you
get
to
come
back
to
work
still
handle
you
job
and
all
this
other
stuff
Bloodworth
be
currently
house
at
the
jail
on
Nashua
Street
one
of
two
facility
that
compromise
the
Suffolk
County
jail
system
the
700
inmate
here
have
not
be
convict
of
any
crime
but
be
be
hold
await
trial
or
the
settlement
of
they
charge
if
they
be
convict
and
give
a
sentence
of
year
or
less
they
could
wind
up
four
mile
away
at
Suffolk
County
other
jail
facility
the
House
of
correction
Bloodworth
be
at
Nashua
street
for
ten
month
now
after
plead
not
guilty
to
charge
of
armed
robbery
and
assault
and
battery
I
go
back
to
court
and
this
case
be
not
look
beatable
so
I
probably
just
plead
out
because
I
have
see
a
lot
of
my
friend
get
burn
in
trial
you
know
what
I
mean
so
I
do
not
think
I
be
go
to
take
a
--
I
will
just
take
a
deal
and
give
they
they
win
if
bloodworth
agree
to
a
prosecutor
office
to
plead
guilty
he
could
face
a
sentence
of
year
the
good
news
be
that
as
he
weigh
that
decision
he
currently
share
he
cell
with
a
childhood
friend
from
the
street
David
Peters
I
do
not
remember
a
time
where
I
do
not
know
he
probably
meet
each
other
when
we
be
like
3
I
and
he
we
play
Dominos
a
lot
sew
take
some
soap
and
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
so
he
have
something
to
play
with
while
we
be
in
the
room
can
not
have
card
can
not
have
nothing
radio
nothing
just
I
and
he
we
call
they
somino
they
be
a
mix
of
dominos
and
soap
you
know
what
I
mean
that
be
the
first
time
I
see
he
in
year
it
feel
good
to
see
he
even
though
under
these
circumstance
we
be
both
incarcerate
we
in
here
the
whole
city
of
Boston
basically
the
bloody
bean
you
know
we
all
over
the
building
you
get
addict
to
the
lifestyle
you
get
addict
to
the
street
the
whole
long
night
fast
life
money
car
fast
woman
everything
that
come
along
with
it
and
you
just
get
a
rush
from
that
after
a
while
that
be
a
gun
right
here
on
my
rib
it
be
a
Einstein
quote
you
have
to
learn
the
rule
to
the
game
and
learn
to
play
they
better
than
anyone
else
I
kind
avenue
ply
that
to
--
I
take
it
from
Einstein
but
kind
of
applied
it
to
the
street
like
bloodworth
Peters
be
also
in
jail
await
trial
or
a
possible
plea
deal
he
be
face
six
charge
include
possession
of
a
firearm
assault
and
battery
on
a
police
officer
and
resist
arrest
because
of
prior
conviction
peters
could
face
up
to
15
year
in
prison
if
find
guilty
when
I
be
a
kid
you
could
not
tell
I
that
I
be
not
go
to
the
NBA
I
think
that
be
where
I
be
go
to
end
up
but
hoop
dream
be
over
they
try
to
take
the
rest
of
my
20s
from

there
so
it
be
like
my
father
be
never
in
my
life
now

might
not
be
there
for
my
son

be
really
a
eye-opener
make
you
wake
up
after
a
while
especially
in
the
hole
you
get
a
lot
of
time
to
think
about

pretty
much
do

McNEE
spend
more
time

of
he
cell
which
provide
another
benefit
better
access
to
coffee
coffee
in
a
place
like
this
if
you
be
like
I
it
be
very
important
get
to
have
my
coffee
first
thing
on
the
list
coffee
nothing
else
to
do
but
sit
around
work
play
card
and
drink
coffee
he
do
about
I
would
say
eight
to
ten
cup
a
day
tough
habit
to
keep
up
with
he
coffee
habit
but
on
the
outside
McNEE
and
he
brother
share
far
more
dangerous
addiction
on
a
average
day
I
could
spend
anywhere
from
$
300
$
500
to
$
a
day
on
what
on
heroin
cocaine
I
live
the
life
of
a
addict
to
the
fullest
and
I
be
embarrass
by
it
drug
have
have
a
hold
on
McNEE
and
Bubanas
since
a
young
age
and
they
play
a
major
role
in
they
trouble
with
the
law
when
we
be
out
there
get
high
all
we
be
think
about
be
the
next
high
you
know
what
I
mean
scheming
plot
what
we
will
do
how
we
be
go
do
this
how
we
will
get
that
one
I
be
like
Jekyll
and
Hyde
when
I
be
use
when
I
be
not
use
when
you
put
something
in
my
system
all
bet
be
off
I
be
just
a
total
--
I
be
a
whole
different
person
I
be
not
a
good
person
I
do
not
do
good
thing
I
do
not
do
nothing
for
nobody
I
be
selfish
and
when
we
be
in
here
and
sober
we
be
not
under
the
influence
of
any
type
of
drug
we
be
talk
about
we
family
you
know
how
we
have
get
to
do
thing
different
you
know
what
I
mean
more
productive
it
be
a
healthier
relationship
you
know
he
be
young
he
do
not
have
to
--
you
do
not
have
to
keep
crash
into
the
same
wall
I
have
be
crash
into
for
the
past
20
year
you
know
obviously
I
be
not
a
good
example
for
he
because
there
be
three
of
we
my
other
brother
graduate
college
already
in
he
third
year
of
law
school
he
choose
to
follow
I
and
I
do
not
like
that
you
know
always
want
to
be
just
like
I
so
I
be
not
very
proud
of
that
obviously
he
be
a
good
kid
though
here
you
go
kid
come
get
it
I
do
not
know
if
you
have
hear
but
I
do
not
do
delivery
no
more
keep
the
change
all
right
Bubanas
could
have
he
next
chance
on
the
outside
very
soon
he
be
due
in
court
in
two
day
to
face
the
judge
on
he
assault
and
battery
charge
but
he
be
optimistic
that
the
case
will
be
throw
out
because
he
girlfriend
be
unwilling
to
testify
against
he
so
I
just
hope
for
the
best
and
expect
the
worst
you
know
expect
the
worst
be
key
to
security

problem
for

why

nick
BUBANAS
admit
he

have
not

he
once
hope
for
but
he
think
he
might
have
discover
one
of
life
secret
figure
out
for
girl

go
to
the
left
for
guy
--
you
want
a
boy

be
how

right
BUBANAS
-
month-old
daughter
be
bear
just
before
he
come
to
jail
I
be
in
the
room
it
be
the
most
beautiful
disgusting
thing
I
have
ever
see
in
my
life
I
think
when
she
come
out
I
cut
the
cord
my
kid
mother
hold
she
first
and
they
pass
she
to
I
and
it
be
weird
how
something
--
how
you
can
just
meet
somebody
and
already
instantly
have
love
for
they
a
love
that
you
can
not
describe
you
would
do
anything
for
they
and
that
be
my
motivation
right
now
to
get
out
and
try
to
do
the
right
thing
for
she
hopefully
it
work
this
time
hopefully
do
I
something
different
she
deserve
it
she
need
she
parent
in
she
life
you

the
same
way

towards

out
there
just
to
relapse

in
a
few
month
or
I
could
be
go
out
--
it
be
the
unknown
you
know
what
I
mean
the
probability
of
I
go
and
return
to
society
do
the
same
thing
I
have
always
do
be
high
you

he
join
four
other
in
assault
another
inmate
on
the
unit
and
be
now
back
in
segregation
but
he
say
the
other
guy
be
the
one
who
start
it
I
guess
he
have
a
issue
with
one
of
my
friend
he
think
that
the
best
way
to
handle
it
would
be
to
try
to
swing
on
my
friend
so
when
we
all
see
that
we
all
react
first
thing
that
we
do
we
throw
he
on
the
floor
flip
he
start
stomp
he
head
into
the
tile
we
only
could
do
so
much
because
we
be
all
in
the
way
I
be
try
to
kick
he
but
my
man
be
right
there
I
be
try
to
hit
he
it
be
all
--
it
be
crazy
it
be
crazy
but
--
yeah
he
catch
the
worst
end
of
it
hey
guy
deputy
stangel
will
decide
how
many
day
peters
must
serve
in
segregation
you
guy
kind
of
mess
up
yourselve
the
way
we
look
at
it
that
be
a
one
on
one
between
that
man
and
Lewis
yeah
but
you
know
yeah
I
know
you
guy
all
join
in
because
you
guy
all
play
as
a
group
yeah
yeah
yeah
you
already
know
I
know
I
know
the
problem
be
we
do
not
like
group
group
be
bad
group
get
people
hurt
group
get
people
charge
with
assault
and
battery
within
the
facility
yeah
yeah
can
not
afford
no
more
no
you
can
not
I
be
here
five
month
I
think
I
get
in
six
fight
be
in
the
hole
six
time
I
mean
you
have
get
to
--
you
have
get
to
fight
it
happen
it
be
just
instinct
you
react
so
this
be
basically
what
happen
you
hit
I
I
hit
you
back
you
think
about
it
after
when
you
get
into
the
hole
and
you
be
sit
there
like
damn
along
with
determine
how
many
day
peters
must
serve
in
segregation
deputy
stangel
must
also
figure
out
where
to
place
he
when
he
stay
in
segregation
be
over
David
Peters
come
into
the
building
without
any
issue
and
since
be
here
have
pick
up
issue
in
the
building
that
make
it
very
difficult
for
we
to
house
he
here
you
guy
do
not
start
this
fight
but
you
guy
do
finish
it
especially
Edgar
all
right
yeah
so
what
be
we
go
to
do
with
you
I
can
not
guarantee
it
obviously
it
be
not
my
end
of
the
business
I
do
this
end
I
do
the
SEG
unit
but
I
will
recommend
that
you
guy
go
back
to
2-4
yeah
Peters
have
have
major
conflict
with
at
least
five
other
inmate
and
the
jail
try
to
separate
likely
combatant
that
make
five
unit
I
can
not
put
David
Peters
on
so
consider
I
only
have
11
unit
to
actually
work
with
here
it
make
he
very
difficult
to
be
house
I
be
probably
a
headache
to
Stangel
I
get
into
fight
and
these
people
these
people
these
people
he
do
not
know
where
to
put
I
everywhere
I
go
I
be
go
to
cause
somebody
a
headache
I
be
go
to
start
something
see
that
be
the
thing
I
do
not
want
to
put
my
man
in
a
situation
where
he
be
go
to
go
somewhere
else
I
be
go
to
make
sure
he
go
somewhere
else
that
be
safe
too
very
much
like
a
soap
opera
a
lot
of
silly
drama
you
just
keep
track
of
it
the
best
you
can
like
I
say
they
do
they
time
they
go
back
to
another
general
population
unit
sometimes
they
make
it
sometimes
they
do
not
they
come
back
here
and
I
be
left
pick
up
the
piece
STANGEL

I
open

put

embarrassed
about

I
be
go
to
have
to
handle
my
you

be
a
short-term
--
little
abbreviation
for
business
you
know
what
I
mean
kind
of
high
tech
here
too
you
get
the
little
touch
light
right

be
hold
out
hope
that

be
it
be
what
he
do
nothing
I
can
say
or
do
will
change
it
if
I
be
out
there
I
would
probably
be
in
the
same
position
I
do
not
listen
to
nobody
either
probably
before
I
leave
here
he
might
be
back
here
who
know
McNEE
be
await
trial
and
if
find
not
guilty
he
could
have
he
own
chance
at

outside
like
he

he
will
have
to
battle
he
drug
addiction
to
avoid
come

I
look
in

mirror
now
my
hair
be

deputy
confiscate
a
dangerous
weapon
from
none
other
than
Delshaun
bloodworth
the
one
who

because
at

we
believe
that

why

Inside
Boston
Suffolk
County
jail
officer
be
always
on
the
lookout
for
weapon
or
other
threat
to
safety
these
unit
be
very
large
can
range
from
30
to
40
inmate
all
the
way
up
to
180
close
to
200
inmate
and
sometimes
one
two
maybe
if
you
be
lucky
three
officer
per
unit
a
officer
have
to
worry
about
180
people
possess
weapon
on
a
daily
basis
so
that
be
why
it
be
very
important
for
they
to
be
on
they
toe
and
look
out
for
suspicious
activity
the
latest
inmate
weapon
confiscate
by
officer
be
find
in
the
segregation
unit
at
the
House
of
correction
what
make
this
significant
obviously
it
be
a
sock
but
in
the
sock
he
have
five
aa
battery
and
these
aa
battery
be
something
he
can
order
for
he
Walkman
radio
through
he
canteen
and
he
choose
to
use
the
battery
in
a
method
that
they
be
not
design
to
do
he
would
drop
they
in
he
sock
tie
the
sock
now
you
have
a
instant
weapon
sometimes
they
spin
it
or
just
drop
it
they
would
have
it
in
they
hand
drop
it
down
bam
that
be
not
something
I
would
want
to
get
hit
in
the
head
with
jail
official
tie
this
weapon
to
one
of
the
newest
inmate
to
arrive
at
the
house
Delshaun
bloodworth
I
do
not
believe
I
be
go
to
get
catch
with
the
battery
in
the
sock
you
know
what
I
mean
so
--
it
be
tie
back
to
Bloodworth
due
to
video
footage
the
video
footage
in
the
unit
capture
the
object
fall
out
of
he
pants
and
at
that
point
they
be
able
to
issue
he
a
disciplinary
report
for
be
in
possession
of
contraband
and
be
in
possession
of
a
weapon
I
throw
it
in
my
jumpsuit
my
one-piece
and
somehow
it
slide
through
my
--
slide
through
my
pants
leg
then
there
be
a
superintendent
he
be
like
what
the
hell
be
this
then
I
be
like
--
I
be
like
oh
my
heart
start
beat
fast
or
whatever
they
accuse
I
of
premeditated
fighting
you
know
what
I
mean
they
think
I
be
go
to
move
on
somebody
with
the
battery
in
the
sock
or
whatever
but
that
be
not
the
case
Bloodworth
say
he
be
catch
in
the
cycle
of
old
unsettled
dispute
from
the
street
it
be
where
I
be
from
it
be
where
I
be
from
you
know
what
I
mean
it
be
like
I
have
a
beef
you
know
what
I
mean
like
people
inherit
money
from
they
family
my
older
man
generation
before
I
they
have
beef
with
the
people
I
have
beef
with
so
you
know
what
I
mean
I
end
up
get
into
a
little
confrontation
with
somebody
move
on
he
then
he
move
on
I
then
we
go
back
and
forth
whatever
so
you
know
I
just
want
to
live
a
normal
life
you
know
what
I
mean
but
even
a
normal
life
in
jail
could
be
a
long
way
off
Bloodworth
have
receive
another
ten
day
in
segregation
for
the
weapon
and
have
be
warn
that
if
he
continue
to
violate
the
rule
he
could
spend
the
remainder
of
he
two
and

Amazon

Eve
2015
good
evening
everyone
and
welcome
Tyler
have
the
evening
off
stock
end
the
year
pretty
much
with
a
whimper
a
1
%
across
the
board
loss
today
cement
the
worst
year
for
the
Dow
and
the
since
the
2008
financial
crisis
the
small
cap
Russell
2000
and
the
Dow
transport
also
have
they
worst
year
in
the
last
seven
the
Nasdaq
be
the
standout
today
the
Dow
lose
178
point
to
finish
the
year
at
the
Nasdaq
drop
58
thanks
in
part
to
a
2
%
drop
in
apple
Apple
turn
in
its
first
negative
year
since
you
guess
it
2008
and
the
500
drop
19
for
the
year
the
Dow
fall
more
than
2
%
the
big
winner
the
Nasdaq
up
better
than
%
and
the
benchmark
be
down
less
than
a
percent
but
down
nonetheless
Bob
Pisani
look
at
what
happen
2015
be
the
year
almost
nothing
work
it
start
out
with
a
few
simple
idea
oil
be
weak
but
it
would
strengthen
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
be
the
best
place
to
invest
in
stock
in
the
world
Europe
be
stick
in
slow
or
no
growth
and
China
be
decelerate
and
also
not
the
place
to
invest
in
stock
turn
out
it
be
all
wrong
oil
go
to
new
low
instead
of
move
up
China
be
a
roller
coaster
but
the
Shanghai
market
be
one
of
the
best
stock
market
in
the
world
it
be
up
9
%
and
Germany
and
most
of
Europe
be
up
in
the
high
single
digit
and
how
about
the
supposedly
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
make
money
in
stock
it
be
flat
a
laggard
so
what
happen
the
main
issue
be
everyone
be
completely
wrong
on
oil
and
it
turn
out
that
cheap
oil
have
a
bigger
impact
than
stock
on
the
economy
than
many
thought
and
in
some
case
a
negative
impact
be
any
of
the
consensus
play
right
the
only
big
bet
that
work
be
Japan
most
trader
feel
that
Japan
stimulus
program
would
benefit
the
stock
market
there
and
they
be
right
about
that
Japan
be
up
over
7
%
but
you
know
it
be
a
pretty
mediocre
year
when
up
7
%
be
consider
some
kind
of
big
victory
and
the
consensus
for
2016
the
economy
be
still
the
best
place
to
invest
the
Fed
will
be
very
cautious
raise
rate
aggressively
China
growth
be
still
decelerate
and
Europe
be
still
stick
in
slow
growth
wait
a
minute
be
not
that
the
2015
forecast
the
one
that
be
wrong
that
be
right
happy
new
year
ev
I
be
Bob
Pisani
at
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
well
now
that
2015
be
in
the
book
what
can
we
expect
from
the
first
month
of
2016
which
be
not
typically
a
strong
one
for
investor
Dominic
Chu
give
we
some
context
some
investor
be
already
look
beyond
the
Santa
Claus
rally
season
toward
what
be
go
to
happen
in
early
2016
after
what
be
be
a
volatile
second
half
of
the
year
some
be
prepare
for
some
of
that
same
volatility
again
in
January
that
be
if
history
end
up
repeat
itself
now
accord
to
market
datum
and
analytic
firm
Kensho
January
have
be
the
second
worst-performing
month
in
the
500
at
least
over
the
last
ten
Januarys
now
on
average
the
month
post
a
loss
a
little
over
1
%
and
it
be
only
a
positive
month
half
the
time
you
compare
that
to
what
be
be
the
best-performing
month
over
the
last
ten
occurrence
that
be
April
where
the
gain
a
average
of
%
and
it
be
be
positive
9
of
the
last
10
time
as
for
the
hot
and
cold
spot
in
the
market
keep
a
eye
on
the
health
care
sector
during
this
time
span
it
be
among
the
best
performer
meanwhile
the
sector
have
underperform
during
that
same
time
period
of
course
the
usual
caveat
apply
here
past
performance
not
necessarily
a
predictor
of
future
performance
but
some
market
history
buff
like
to
use
it
for
a
little
added
color
for
nightly
business
report
I
be
Dominic
Chu
here
to
talk
more
about
the
market
and
he
stock
pick
this
week
we
market
monitor
be
rich
Steinberg
he
be
president
of
Steinberg
Global
Asset
Management
last
time
he
be
on
in
January
of
this
year
he
recommend
Devon
Energy
which
be
down
48
%
MACY
which
be
down
47
%
and
Gilead
which
be
up
6
%
rich
welcome
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
do
you
still
own
all
three
of
those
stock
or
any
of
those
three
stock
yeah
we
own
Gilead
still
we
sell
MACY
earlier
in
the
year
when
we
see
that
cheaper
oil
price
and
gas
price
be
not
help
consumer
and
unfortunately
we
still
own
Devon
we
think
it
be
probably
oversell
you
think
it
be
oversold
all
right
let
talk
about
the
market
in
general
you
just
hear
a
forecast
by
a
number
of
people
that
2016
may
be
more
of
the
same
do
you
agree
with
that
yeah-i
think
we
be
go
to
have
some
fit
and
start
in
this
market
if
you
look
at
next
year
earnings
the
we
think
be
go
to
earn
about
$
125
which
get
you
to
about
in
the
sue
6
%
-
ish
return
6
%
to
7
%
with
dividend
a
little
more
than
that
but
it
be
go
to
be
a
dramamine
kind
of
year
we
be
go
to
have
a
lot
of
volatility
that
be
go
to
make
people
a
little
nauseous
but
you
contend
that
you
can
profit
from
volatility
if
you
timing
be
right
correct
yeah
I
think
if
you
have
cash
on
the
sideline
right
now
you
should
be
pick
you
point
of
where
you
want
entry
either
into
the
market
as
a
whole
or
in
individual
name
and
let
the
price
come
to
you
so
a
bunch
of
we
portfolio
we
have
higher
than
normal
cash
level
and
that
be
what
we
plan
be
to
do
next
year
and
you
have
also
give
we
some
stock
pick
tonight
Corning
be
one
of
you
first
pick
here
and
you
think
that
it
have
some
up
side
to
it
that
be
in
we
value
portfolio
it
be
have
a
couple
rough
quarter
we
analyst
have
a
$
2300
target
on
it
strong
management
it
have
a
good
dividend
yield
and
the
play
be
really
in
what
they
call
guerrilla
gas
in
the
automotive
space
which
be
a
lighter
windshield
also
as
people
start
to
shift
toward
the
next
generation
of
high
def
tv
it
be
a
cheap
stock
all
right
PAYPAL
the
spinoff
from
Ebay
the
target
you
have
on
this
be
48
the
stock
trading
at
23
time
earnings
and
it
be
a
continuation
play
in
both
e-commerce
and
digital
payment
again
strong
management
throw
a
lot
of
free
cash
flow
off
the
stock
be
another
bargain
here
at
these
level
and
ventus
which
be
a
healthcare
reit
yeah
this
be
a
interesting
name
it
be
yield
about
%
and
fit
into
a
theme
of
you
want
to
own
high
dividend-paying
stock
into
next
year
strong
management
and
we
like
both
the
theme
of
age
population
as
well
as
the
health
care
space
they
be
very
very
strong
in
they
cash
flow
and
we
think
they
be
go
to
be
20
%
up
side
in
that
name
thank
you
so
much
for
join
we
tonight
have
a
great
new
year
rich
Steinberg
with
Steinberg
global
asset
management
well
2016
promise
to
be
a
big
political
year
and
the
wind
of
change
be
swirl
from
state
wages
to
new
law
on
the
book
how
presidential
candidate
plan
to
deal
with
tax
be
up
next
we
will
tell
you
who
be
impact
start
tomorrow
the
new
inflation-adjusted
income
bracket
kick
into
effect
most
taxpayer
will
not
be
impact
much
but
the
cutoff
for
the
top
bracket
move
higher
to
just
over
and
that
be
up
nearly
$
so
as
we
head
into
this
election
year
how
do
the
candidate
tax
plan
stack
up
for
that
we
turn
to
John
Harwood
at
the
White
House
happy
new
year
John
good
to
see
you
as
always
happy
new
year
sue
if
you
have
a
republican
get
elect
with
a
republican
Congress
potential
big
change
here
in
tax
policy
you
mention
the
$
threshold
for
the
%
rate
which
be
the
top
personal
rate
under
president
Obama
term
you
have
get
candidate
who
want
to
raise
that
as
low
as
10
%
that
be
Ted
Cruz
on
a
tax
plan
which
would
apply
to
all
income
under
$
you
have
get
Jeb
Bush
to
28
Marco
Rubio
have
a
smaller
cut
to
35
%
but
he
would
get
rid
of
capital
gain
and
dividend
tax
which
would
have
a
huge
impact
on
people
at
the
top
of
the
income
scale
absolutely
you
know
this
year
terrorism
and
immigration
be
some
of
the
top
theme
of
the
campaign
as
we
get
into
2016
do
you
think
the
focus
will
return
more
to
the
various
tax
plan
by
the
candidate
I
do
because
all
the
campaign
start
out
with
a
emphasis
on
do
something
about
both
income
inequality
especially
on
the
democratic
side
and
stagnant
middle-class
wages
I
think
that
be
go
to
be
the
mean
that
the
campaign
revert
to
and
of
course
Hillary
Clinton
have
be
pretty
aggressive
in
lay
out
policy
but
we
have
not
hear
about
she
tax
plan
yet
that
be
go
to
be
one
of
the
thing
to
watch
for
in
January
what
do
she
want
the
top
rate
to
be
be
she
go
to
keep
it
at
and
go
after
loophole
or
be
she
go
to
increase
it
be
way
Bernie
Sanders
want
to
that
be
where
the
democratic
competition
be
right
now
if
you
be
a
bet
man
which
do
you
think
she
would
do
I
be
think
that
Hillary
Clinton
be
go
to
try
to
keep
the
--
do
everything
she
can
to
raise
the
revenue
she
need
without
raise
that
top
rate
that
be
the
rate
that
she
husband
leave
in
office
at
the
end
of
bill
Clinton
presidency
I
think
she
do
not
want
to
give
Republicans
the
argument
that
she
be
go
to
raise
tax
across
the
board
go
forward
I
think
loophole
a
safer
place
to
be
but
we
will
see
how
bold
she
be
go
to
be
in
she
plan
and
what
about
Bernie
Sanders
how
do
you
think
he
plan
will
play
with
the
voter
well
it
play
well
in
the
left
of
the
democratic
party
when
I
interview
he
some
month
ago
I
say
if
we
go
back
to
the
90
%
top
rate
that
obtain
post-world
war
ii
under
Dwight
Eisenhower
I
say
be
that
obviously
too
high
for
you
he
say
not
obviously
too
high
he
have
not
propose
that
Donald
Trump
be
go
around
say
Bernie
Sanders
would
take
it
to
90
%
but
he
would
go
a
lot
higher
than
Hillary
Clinton
you
can
bet
on
that
we
have
not
see
a
specific
tax
plan
from
Bernie
Sanders
but
I
be
think
at
least
50
%
would
be
where
he
would
go
you
be
go
to
have
such
a
interesting
year
John
thank
you
so
much
it
be
go
to
be
fun
it
will
John

the

Amazon
may
be
in
a
class
all
by
itself
accord
to
a
New
York
Times
article
today
Amazon
steamroll
its
way
through
2015
as
it
continue
to
capture
more
market
share
for
every
dollar
Americans
spend
shopping
online
this
year
51
cent
of
that
go
to
Amazon
and
if
that
be
not
enough
the
company
say
it
have
a
record-breaking
holiday
season
as
well
ship
some
200
million

will

Ross
Gerber
join

of
Gerber
Kawasaki
happy
new
year
Ross
good
to
see
you
as
always
happy
new
year
good
to
see
you
too
that
be
a
pretty
glowing
article
in
the
time
they
maintain
almost
nothing
can
stop
Adamson
right
now
do
you
agree
with
that
I
agree
100
%
Amazon
be
just
a
gorilla
of
the
retail
industry
and
with
they
other
business
aw
grow
so
fast
it
really
add
a
second
you
know
really
rapidly
grow
business
to
ams
Amazon
stable
I
really
do
not
see
anybody
come
close
to
take
share
from
they
right
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
challenge
with
they
prime
day
for
instance
which
they
put
in
in
July
which
be
traditionally
kind
of
a
soft
spot
for
the
retailer
they
almost
force
the
walmart
of
the
world
to
step
up
to
the
plate
with
they
right
yeah
they
be
basically
take
everybody
lunch
who
be
not
move
forward
with
they
technology
so
like
home
depot
for
example
have
make
some
stride
with
they
online
a
place
like
Ulta
salon
have
a
great
online
and
they
have
these
little
niche
but
Amazon
be
just
right
in
the
middle
of
everything
and
now
they
be
go
after
handmade
goods
and
etsy
as
they
continue
to
grow
different
market
they
will
continue
to
grow
and
capture
even
more
maybe
you
own
the
stock
how
much
upside
do
you
think
be
still
in
this
stock
well
I
think
it
have
a
lot
of
potential
up
side
because
we
like
to
think
long
term
so
when
we
say
how
much
up
side
be
leave
in
the
stock
it
could
grow
and
grow
for
many
more
year
on
the
short
term
we
still
see
this
20
%
growth
continue
for
Amazon
and
we
expect
the
stock
to
continue
to
grow
at
the
same
pace
we
hope
how
do
they
grow
profit
though
now
that
be
a
better
question
right
because
Wall
Street
love
the
stock
but
they
punish
other
stock
when
they
profit
be
this
small
it
be
very
interesting
yeah
you
know
this
be
a
phenomenon
among
growth
company
like
Netflix
and
Amazon
for
example
where
the
management
understand
that
they
be
in
full
growth
mode
so
they
spend
every
dollar
they
make
on
growth
and
what
they
do
be
they
very
tightly
control
it
so
that
they
do
not
actually
lose
a
lot
of
money
and
need
to
raise
money
or
anything
like
that
they
just
run
it
to
basically
break
even
but
to
grow
revenue
at
a
very
high
clip
with
the
idea
they
will
eventually
cut
back
on
some
of
the
project
and
the
marketing
cost
and
then
you
will
have
a
nice
margin
in
there
to
make
a
profit
so
that
be
the
risk
in
Amazon
and
I
have
to
say
Amazon
be
not
a
safe
conservative
investment
it
have
a
huge
valuation
because
we
all
know
it
be
a
dominant
player
and
we
have
to
skeep
that
in
mind
when
invest
in
Amazon
if
they
do
anything
wrong
it
could
be
a
very
costly
investment
very
quickly
I
have
about
30
seconds
do
you
consider
it
a
growth
stock
or
a
technology
stock
or
perhaps
a
blend
of
both
I
consider
it
a
growth
stock
I
think
Amazon
use
technology
incredibly
efficient
but
what
they
really
do
amazing
be
logistics
management
this
be
the
amazing
part
of
what
Amazon
do
and
why
they
be
so
successful
but
it
be
just
a
pure
growth
retailer
in
my
mind
thanks
so
much
Ross
have
a
great
new
year
my
pleasure
you
too
Ross
Gerber
with
Gerber
Kawasaki
well
they
say
a
diamond

some
in

jewelry
business
2015
may
have
seem
like
forever
as
the
demand
for
the
stone
flow
so
be
there
a
bright
spot
we
will
try
and
get
some
clarity
next
well
tonight

New
York
City
1
million
people
be
expect
to
jam

Square
one
sector
that
have
dim
this

Morgan

look
at
whether
the

have
lose

luster
when
the

strike
midnight
tonight
one
sector
will
not
be
sad
to
say
good-bye
to

the

wholesaler
dealer
and
diamond
manufacturer
find
themselves
with
excess
inventory
and
so
diamond
price
take
a
hit
why
the
weakness
New
york-based
Peter
Fabricant
who
trade
million
of
dollar
worth
of
diamond
wholesale
each
year
blame
weak
global
demand
we
lose
three
of
we
biggest
consumer
that
be
China
Russia
and
India
and
what
have
happen
be
they
be
consume
and
now
they
be
net
seller
diamond
be
price
in
dollar
he
say
a
stronger
greenback
be
partly
to
blame
especially
in
Russia
where
the
ruble
have
plunge
another
factor
low
oil
price
which
have
tamp
down
demand
in
the
Middle
East
the
bright
spot
have
be
the
auction
house
have
be
command
record
price
for
multimillion-dollar
rare
stone
the
less
expensive
engagement
ring
market
have
remain
rock
solid
but
even
here
taste
be
change
in
the
United
States
of
America
we
see
good
demand
for
diamond
under
the
CARAT
particularly
diamond
specific
diamond
and
even
some
fancy
shape
when
we
look
at
the
millennial
we
find
that
they
be
not
that
interested
in
so-called
high-end
crazy
luxury
what
they
be
interested
in
thing
that
have
spiritual
or
how
should
I
say
heritage
meaning
heirloom
meaning
so
lynellial
want
to
spend
money
on
something
that
be
lasting
that
have
value
over
time
it
be
not
just
dollar
value
it
be
emotional
value
between
de
Beers
which
be
own
by
Anglo
American
and
Al
Rosa
its
russian
rival
they
control
nearly
of
the
world
diamond
supply
expert
say
both
company
be
now
make
steep
cut
to
restrict
that
supply
that
should
help
stabilize
price
in
2016
but
the
wild
card
be
go
to
be
China
and
whether
demand
there
begin
to
recover
start
with
February
chinese
new
year
if
you
look
at
the
global
diamond
industry
and
you
look
at
global
diamond
demand
from
consumer
certainly
Christmas
be
very
important
but
it
be
almost
I
would
say
that
the
chinese
new
year
be
come
up
there
as
a
equally
important
seasonal
gifting
holiday
like
other
commodity
market
that
be
cyclical
diamond
expert
remain
optimistic
that
the
price
of
these
pressure
stone
will
rebind
I
have
be

year
I
know
it
be
hard
to
believe
I
have
see
the

ten
year

not
be
make

they
be
literal
off
the
market
well
that
be
the
defense
side
of
the
story
but
what
about
the
could
you
sayers
Tonight
CBS
Lori
take
a
closer
look
at
the
cosby
case
I
encourage
people
to
report
but
I
also
be
very
understand
about
the
people
who
choose
not
to
because
you
do
not
know
what
be
in
store
for
you
as
a
survivor
of
sexual
assault
no
one
know
better
than
Karen
how
difficult
it
be
for
rape
victim
to
speak
out
she
be
kidnap
and
rape
by
a
Sharon
20
year
ago
and
when
she
report
it
she
painful
private
tragedy
become
a
public
ordeal
that
be
why
do
you
know
why
she
be
hopeful
the
accusation
against
bill
cosby
and
arrest
could
break
stigma
and
it
will
highlight
the
violence
and
intimidation
victim
often
report
I
think
it
would
encourage
people
because
it
be
very
empower
to
see
all
these
woman
come
forward
at
the
same
time
but
she
warn
what
happen
in
the
case
cool
also
determine
the
effect
on
the
other
side
we
do
not
know
what
be
go
to
happen
during
the
trial
what
kind
of
fishbowl
these
woman
be
go
to
be
in
how
they
hive
be
go
to
be
scrutinize
and
that
might
be
something
that
cause
woman
to
shy
away
from
it
National
data
show
only
2
%
of
rapist
will
ever
spend
a
day
in
prison
but
she
still
encourage
survivor
to
report
they
attack
if
not
for
themselves
for
other
because
nothing
you
can
undo
what
happen
to
you
but
you
can
prevent
another
woman
from
be
hurt
and
that
be
what
motivate
I
it
be
say
that
a
rapist
rape
approximately
seven
time
before
catch
and
cosby
could
be
especially
groundbreaking
because
if
convict
it
would
show
even
the
most
powerful
and
beloved
figure
can
be
hold
aaccountable

what
to
expect
wind
drop
below
a
advisory
level
of
53
but
the
dry
warm
offshore
flow
continue
through
Saturday
then
the
big
change
will
come
three
frontal
system
to
start
the
year
first
one
late
Saturday
into

probably
the
one
of
the

one
Tuesday
in

storm
let

a
look
at
the

that
we
have
contingent
a
group
of
people
walk
through
business
to
see
where
they
stand
as
well
as
some
of
the
home
above
109
so
that
we
can
give
the
damage
assessment
process
well
underway
and
then
from
there
begin
the
recovery
effort
so
you
talk
about
the
recovery
effort
which
be
now
about
to
start
let
talk
about
the
rescue
effort
how
extensive
be
they
what
be
involve
start
really
over
the
weekend
where
we
have
a
lot
of
flash
flooding
because
of
the
torrential
and
historic
rain
we
experience
here
in
the
area
we
do
a
large
number
of
vehicle
rescue
earlier
on
and
the
weekend
and
earlier
part
of
the
week
as
river
rise
we
begin
to
get
people
who
be
either
stranded
or
have
stay
in
they
property
and
area
that
either
they
be
there
to
protect
they
or
they
do
not
think
they
would
flood
we
do
well
over
50
rescue
rescue
well
over
100
people
as
well
as
some
animal
from
some
of
those
home
if
the
course
of

of

many
of
the

we
be
start
to
see
some
of
the

up
a
portion
of

up
south
of
Eureka
to
give
we
access
to
a
large
subdivision
down

some
300

hopefully
get
it
hospital
there
have
be

just
go
out
to
the

everything
this
holiday

we
have
get
a
in
you
opinion

of
time
when

very
quickly
you

some
of
the
essential
thing
that
you
need
the
Red

be
there

we
have
a
family
the
other
night
that
come
in
a
older

health
service
or
bewildered
about

a
little
about

home
they
can
not
yet
because
it
be
not
safe
or
they
home
possibly
could
be
flood
because
they
be
in
a
floodplain
area
so
a
lot
of
stress
the
Red
Cross
we
priority
provide
the
basic
need
of
food
shelter
and
clothing
and
add
the
next
step
start
to
recovery
and
the
quicker
we
can
get
people
into
recovery
and
start
to
get
back
to
that
normal
life
that
be
when
healing
really
start
the
to
take
place
let
I
ask
you
and
Scott
Barthelmass
as
well
start
with
you
Cindy
Erickson
how
do
this
compare
to
other
disaster
in
term
of
magnitude
in
this
region
you
know
what
this
have
just
be
incredible
many
have
compare
it
to
the
flood
and
for
the
American
Red
Cross
it
certainly
be
a
huge
disaster
because
it
be
not
just
in
one
area
it
be
in
multiple
area
so
the
Red
Cross
I
mean
we
plan
for
disaster
365
day
a
year
24-7
over
9
%
of
we
workforce
be
volunteer
and
so
we
be
able
to
deploy
at
a
moment
notice
so
to
be
able
to
stand
up
numerous
a
dozen
shelter
within
a
couple
of
day
be
pretty
remarkable
of
the
community
and
the
community
resilience
Scott
Barthelmass
how
do
it
compare
for
a
small
town
on
a
big
river
you
know
we
district
cover
82
square
mile
and
we
actually
serve
multiple
community
Eureka
be
the
main
city
and
the
center
of
we
district
and
there
be
flooding
in
1982
substantial
flooding
in
2008
but
we
have
not
see
devastation
like
this
before
and
I
think
as
the
crux
allude
and
other
the
flood
event
will
come
to
a
end
the
recovery
effort
will
last
for
week
and
maybe
for
some
people
year
to
get
they
business
back
up
to
where
they
be
and
they
home
and
the
like
I
be
go
to
have
to
leave
you
because
I
have
other
thing
that
be
pend
but
we
appreciate
you
cover
this
story
and
again
hat
off
to
the
community
as
they
stand
up
to
this
and
firefighter
on
the
line

still
Baghdad
ambassador
to
Washington
Lukman
faily
tell
we
yesterday
it
be
a
milestone
retake
Ramadi
be
symbolic
as
you
be
just
talk
about
and
at
the
same
time
strategic
symbolic
in
the
sense
that
we
be
tell
the
world
the
iraqi
army
be
retake
initiative
and
that
Isis
will
be
kick
out
of
Iraq
once
and
for
all
how
long
will
it
take
they
to
clear
the
city
enough
so
that
the
ten
of
thousand
who
flee
the
civilian
will
feel
comfortable
return
it
will
not
be
a
overnight
work
because
the
booby
trap
issue
we
have
learn
a
great
deal
in
Tikrit
when
we
cleanse
it
that
it
take
a
few
week
just
to
make
sure
that
some
of
the
place
be
--
booby
trap
they
have
use
be
tremendous
use
car
bomb
as
well
that
be
another
issue
we
be
deal
with
enemy
who
do
not
have
any
rule
of
engagement
just
the
same
prime
minister
Haider
al-Abadi
visit
Ramadi
this
week
vow
to
set
he
sight
on
a
far
larger
prize
in
the
quest
to
drive
isis
know
as
daesh
in
Arabic
out
of
Iraq
we
will
raise
this
flag
and
purge
this
land
from
the
last
member
of
the
we
tell
the
people
of
Nineveh
the
people
of
Mosul
that
we
be
come
to
liberate
you
from
Daesh
and
Isis
will
be
defeat
and
flee
as
they
be
defeat
in
Ramadi
Mosul
250
mile
north
of
Baghdad
have
a
population
of
two
million
before
Isis
take
it
five
time
the
size
of
Ramadi
and
the
largest
city
in
the
militant
control
do
you
think
the
approach
that
you
use
combined
you
force
with
a
lot
of
American
air
power
be
that
enough
of
a
model
to
then
retake
Mosul
which
the
president
have
say
be
the
goal
popular
mobilization
force
we
have
local
tribe
participat
in
it
in
Ramadi
we
focus
on
the
local
tribe
we
counterterrorism
force
and
the
strong
cooperation
of
the
allied
force
in
relation
to
the
supremacy
of
the
air
we
need
to
carry
on
with
such
a
model
in
retake
Mosul
however
we
also
have
the
kurdish
partner
of
ours
the
Peshmerga
we
have
the
tribe
we
have
the
local
as
well
as
the
government
and
as
well
as
anybody
who
would
like
to
contribute
include
the
allied
in
the
retake
or
liberating
of
Mosul
that
be
a
bigger
project
that
be
a
much
bigger
project
a
different
take
come
from
Jim
Jeffrey
Ambassador
to
Iraq
from
2010
to
2012
he
say
Ramadi
be
a
significant
victory
but
not
a
guarantee
of
future
success
to
what
degree
do
the
way
Ramadi
be
retake
which
be
use
the
iraqi
army
train
by
the
back
by
a
lot
of
we
bombing
offer
a
model
for
take
the
much
larger
city
of
Mosul
it
offer
a
model
with
several
exception
First
of
all
in
Anbar
province
in
Ramadi
we
have
a
lot
of
Sunni
police
Sunni
member
of
the
military
and
Sunni
Arab
tribe
fight
along
with
we
that
be
not
go
ot
be
the
case
up
in
Mosul
to
the
same
degree
Mosul
be
bigger
Isis
will
fight
harder
for
it
the
be
go
to
have
to
put
a
lot
more
ground
force
and
a
lot
more
fire
power
in
order
to
take
that
down
in
any
time
in
the
near
future
do
you
think
it
will
actually
take
american
quote
boots
on
the
ground
that
be
combat
boot
on
the
ground
or
trainer
and
advisors
on
the
ground
I
think
it
will
take
both
trainer
and
advisors
with
the
unit
who
be
go
into
combat
that
they
have
train
and
at
least
some
american
what
we
call
maneuver
battalion
to
prime
the
pump
and
get
other
people
to
encourage
to
take
the
same
risk
that
we
troops
be
take
president
Obama
have
say
the
force
in
Iraq
will
train
and
advise
iraqi
troops
but
have
no
direct
combat
role
and
in
Baghdad
Army
Colonel
Steve
Warren
say
this
week
that
air
power
have
be
key
to
the
iraqi
victory
so
far
what
be
more
Prime
Minister
Abadi
have
say
he
do
not
want
combat
troops
on
the
ground
again
AMBASSADOR
FAILY
we
do
not
think
we
need
that
we
think
might
be
easier
for
we
to
say
yes
at
this
moment
but
it
will
be
cost
more
there
be
a
cost
political
regional
and
domestic
for
we
and
we
be
very
wary
about
that
and
we
be
very
clear
on
the
nuance
of
it
reclaim
the
whole
of
Iraq
also
hinge
on
whether
the
country
shiite-dominated
government
can
bring
together
its
rival
ethnic
group
the
majority
shiite
the
Sunnis
the
Kurds
and
minority
like
the
turkmen
and
the
christian
to
that
point

serious
defeat
to
Daesh
staging
for
liberating
mosul
all
reversible
without
fundamental
settlement
to
Iraq
fail
political
system
Jim
Jeffrey
say
it
be
critical
that
Iraq
shiite-led
government
heed
that
warning
so
if
you
could
say
one
thing
to
prime
minster
abadus
about
what
he
need
to
do
if
he
can
take
this
success
and
multiply
it
what
would
it
be
Isis
will
not
disappear
Iraq
will
not
remain
united
if
you
can
not
find
a
way
to
reach
out
to
the
Sunni
Arabs
and
the
Kurds
and
if
he
do
not
take
that
advice
this
be
gon
na
be
a
long
difficult
struggle
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
face
the
specter
of
a
sunni
shia
cataclysm
in
the
entire
region
if
we
get
this
wrong
it
be
that
serious
at
this
point
for
he
part
ambassador
faily
insist
he
government
have
get
the
message
we
be
already
decentralize
in
a
lot
of
issue
we
have
already
learn
from
Salahadi
and
from
we
will
carry
on
do
that
model
that
be
a
workable
model
for
we
but
at
the
same
time
we
need
to
be
clear
everybody
have
to
pull
they
weight
faily
also
argue
that
Abadi
face
a
parliament
with
many
uncompromising
shiite
figure
have
a
political
tightrope
to
walk
he
be
do
he
best
he
be
do
he
best
he
be
pull
all
the
string
he
can
he
have
a
sense
of
urgency
in
address
this
reform
and
other
as
well
you
have
to
bear
in
mind
in
the
i
think
other
need
to
understand
that
and
I
think
they
need
to
be
fair
in
of
what
they
be
ask
the
prime
minister
to
do
in
the
meantime
there
be
other
battlefield
test
ahead
like
retake
Fallujah
which
lie
between
Ramadi
and
Baghdad
stay

stunning
performance
at
the
Kennedy
Center
prove
why
the
queen
of
soul
say
she
will
never
retire
but
first
what
kid
can
tell
we
about
temptation
and
self
-
restraint
exactly
one
year
ago
we
begin
bring
you
make
sense
story
every
Thursday
we
kick
off
2015
with
economics
correspondent
Paul
Solman
explore
how
to
fulfill
you
new
year
resolution
tonight
we
think
it
make
sense
to
take
another
look
I
really
want
to
learn
how
to
knit
stay
better
organize
I
be
go
to
create
a
schedule
try
to
combat
procrastination
and
really
try
to
focus
a
little
more
save
more
money
actually
go
to
work
harder
that
be
-
that
be
pretty
much
it
and
how
be
you
go
to
do
that
OOH
Umm
so
new
year
resolution
people
make
they
and
just
about
as
often
they
break
they
why
because
they
be
formulate
in
a
way
that
be
a
general
good
intention
but
it
be
not
a
plan
if
there
be
a
man
with
a
plan
for
lead
we
not
into
temptation
it
be
psychologist
Walter
Mischel
author
of
the
marshmallow
test
master
self-control
and
by
master
it
work
harder
save
more
key
factor
in
economic
success
the
book
be
base
on
half-a
-
century
of
research
by
Mischel
and
other
that
begin
with
a
simple
experiment
now
among
the
most
famous
and
replicate
in
the
history
of
psychology
there
be
a
marshmallow
you
can
either
wait
and
I
will
bring
you
back
another
one
so
you
can
have
two
or
you
can
eat
it
now
Mischel
run
this
self-control
experiment
on
some
650
preschooler
at
Stanford
University
in
the
late
and
early
most
gobble
up
the
puffy
confection
but
one-third
abstain
long
enough
to
get
another
you
get
two
and
delay
gratification
at
even
the
earliest
age
have
be
show
to
correlate
powerfully
or
else
equal
with
prosperity
later
in
life
Mischel
find
that
the
successful
self-denier
have
a
pretty
simple
strategy
which
be
they
transform
a
impossibly
difficult
situation
into
a
relatively
easy
one
by
distract
themselves
by
turn
around
by
put
the
marshmallow
farther
away
or
I
can
do
it
by
explore
my
nasal
cavity
or
my
ear
canal
and
toy
with
the
product
the
fancy
word
for
it
now
be
executive
control
I
be
able
to
use
my
prefrontal
cortex
my
cool
brain
not
my
hot
emotional
system
I
be
able
to
use
my
cool
brain
in
order
to
have
strategy
that
allow
I
to
make
this
miserable
effortful
wait
effortless
and
easy
or
not
so
effortless
and
easy
10
minute
10
minute
10
minute
10
minute
10
minute
oh
10
minute
I
think
some
people
find
it
much
easier
to
exert
control
than
other
but
no
matter
whether
one
be
reasonably
good
at
this
overall
or
easily
bad
at
this
overall
it
can
be
enormously
improve
so
how
do
exert
executive
control
as
a
adult
face
vice
more
invite
than
marshmallow
when
childish
distraction
may
no
longer
work
so
if
I
have
a
new
year
resolution
to
drink
a
little
less
than
I
do
what
do
I
do
what
you
need
be
a
plan
that
say
at
the
end
of
the
day
pm
be
the
time
that
I
be
likely
to
have
a
drink
right
ok
I
have
to
have
a
substitute
activity
at
that
time
so
there
will
be
a
alternative
and
it
will
be
very
very
practice
I
mean
to
give
you
a
example
from
my
own
experience
a
chocolate
mousse
be
generally
irresistible
for
I
he
self-control
strategy
I
will
order
the
fruit
salad
and
that
be
a
specific
rehearsed
plan
so
before
the
guy
can
tempt
I
with
the
mousse
I
be
already
order
the
fruit
salad
and
just
to
be
safe
the
idea
that
the
chocolate
mousse
before
it
be
bring
out
of
the
restaurant
kitchen
may
have
have
a
cockroach
have
a
little
breakfast
on
it
first
behavioral
economist
Dean
Karlan
have
pioneer
a
different
approach
I
go
to
a
fancy
restaurant
with
some
friend
I
know
that
after
I
have
have
my
wine
the
dessert
menu
come
I
will
order
the
dessert
even
if
I
swear
I
be
not
go
to
up
front
so
I
will
turn
to
my
friend
and
I
will
say
if
-
fine
yes
let
get
the
wine
but
if
I
eat
dessert
then
I
owe
you
$
100
Karlan
first
become
involve
with
such
so-called
commitment
contract
in
Grad
School
research
they
even
make
one
with
a
friend
who
like
Karlan
want
to
lose
weight
and
keep
it
off
the
contract
be
for
$
so
the
point
be
to
make
it
for
a
lot
of
money
enough
that
it
would
be
really
really
painful
to
write
that
check
how
much
do
you
lose
I
lose
48
pound
grow
out
of
that
experience
Karlan
co-found
a
web
site
call
STICKK
in
part
for
its
distinctly
non-carrot
-
like
approach
to
help
people
reach
they
goal
if
you
put
monetary
stake
up
then
you
can
have
it
so
that
you
money
go
to
say
a
friend
who
be
go
to
hold
you
accountable
or
one
of
the
more
popular
option
be
the
anti-charity
now
the
money
go
to
something
that
you
hate
the
Foundation
be
one
of
the
most
popular
cause
that
people
do
not
like
and
choose
on
this
site
the
National
Rifle
Association
the
National
Rifle
Association
we
also
have
super
pac
both
leave
and
right
and
those
be
very
popular
because
they
kind
of
capture
all
the
issue
all
in
one
bundle
keep
in
mind
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
reporting
of
the
failure
then
the
money
go
to
some
truly
odious
cause
I
mean
odious
to
I
odious
to
you
that
be
the
key
part
and
the
other
part
that
also
be
very
popular
and
very
effective
for
a
lot
of
people
be
not
the
monetary
part
but
be
the
public
aspect
of
it
so
you
would
have
to
admit
that
you
fail
on
facebook
or
twitter
but
why
do
we
resolution
so
often
fail
because
human
like
you
and
I
and
Walter
Mischel
both
of
we
former
smoker
temporally
discount
value
immediate
reward
much
more
than
those
in
the
future
so
if
it
be
not
now
it
be
essentially
never
because
the
future
for
example
the
cancer
that
I
could
get
if
I
keep
smoking
be
probabilistic
it
be
distant
we
do
not
know
for
sure
and
so
it
might
as
well
not
be
there
unless
I
do
something
that
make
the
faraway
consequence
immediate
and
vivid
hence
the
graphic
warning
on
canadian
cigarette
a
similar
image
50
year
ago
get
Mischel
a
three-packs-a-day
addict
to
quit
practically
cold
Turkey
that
be
a
man
with
metastasize
lung
cancer
and
those
little
green
x-marks
be
for
where
the
radiation
go
that
be
the
beginning
of
my
end
my
smoking
because
the
image
of
I
on
a
gurney
with
little
green
x-marks
be
very
very
vivid
and
it
make
the
distant
probabilistic
consequence
something
that
be
immediate
and
now
and
change
the
cigarette
from
a
huge
temptation
to
a
small
dose
of
poison
in
the
end
then
the
most
powerful
way
to
have
control
be
by
transform
what
the
stimulus
mean
but
of
course
everything
follow
for
make
that
resolution
in
the
first
place
it
start
the
conversation
about
try
to
change
something
you
have
to
really
want
to
because
you
be
take
that
delay
goal
to
live
longer
to
live
healthier
to
have
retirement
fund
when
you
need
they
rather
than
to
not
have
they
it
be
what
we
want
and
how
we
think
about
what
we
want
that
control
and
regulate
what
we
be
able
to
do
Paul
Solman
report
for
the
PBS
Newshour
from
hopefully
the
land
of
self-control
see
any
good
movie
lately
for
we
end
of
the
year
review
we
have
ask
a
couple
of
film
critic
to
ponder
that
Jeffrey
Brown
have
we
look
and
for
we
quick
walk
through
the
year
in
film
we
be
join
by
film
critic
Ann
Hornaday
of
the
Washington
post
and
Mark
Sargent
of
PACIVICA
radio
welcome
to
both
of
you
not
you
top
ten
not
you
top
five
pick
one
to
start
either
best
or
favorite
Ann
you
choose
spotlight
I
do
why
full
disclosure
it
happen
to
my
boss
but
even
if
I
do
not
know
one
of
the
people
portray
in
the
film
I
would
have
choose
it
this
be
the
story
of
the
Boston
Globe
investigation
into
sexual
abuse
within
the
catholic
church
they
do
in
2001
and
2002
and
a
dramatization
of
the
process
it
be
a
exquisite
piece
of
shoe
leather
journalism
filmmake
about
shoe
leather
journalism
old
fashion
what
I
have
say
in
the
past
be
it
be
really
legacy
filmmaking
about
legacy
journalism
because
it
return
to
some
solid
fundamental
value
of
filmmaking
we
have
a
short
clip
let
take
a
look
that
be
why
I
have
the
reaction
I
know
there
be
other
I
think
that
be
the
bigger
story
the
number
clearly
indicate
there
be
senior
clergy
involve
that
be
all
they
do
indicate
you
be
tell
I
if
we
start
with
50
pedophile
priest
in
BOSTON
--
we
be
get
into
the
same
cat
fight
you
get
into
on
porter
which
make
a
lot
of
noise
but
change
thing
not
one
bit
we
need
to
focus
on
the
institution
not
the
individual
priest
actice
and
policy
show
I
the
church
manipulate
the
system
so
these
guy
would
not
have
to
face
charge
show
I
they
put
those
same
priest
back
into
parish
time
and
time
again
show
I
this
be
systemic
that
it
come
from
the
top-down
a
lot
of
wonderful
actor
understate
film
it
be
superb
exercise
of
restraint
on
every
level
write
by
Tom
McCarthy
who
be
a
tremendous
filmmaker
he
never
put
too
much
spin
on
the
ball
there
be
no
kind
of
billboard
scene
tell
the
audience
how
to
feel
it
be
very
slow
go
very
scrupulously
restrained
ensemble
piece
that
be
the
other
reason
why
I
love
it
it
be
a
true
ensemble
piece
where
you
see
these
fantastic
actor
subsume
they
own
ego
and
desire
for
the
spotlight
and
work
like
a
real
team
Mark
Ruffalo
you
choose
a
sci-fi
film
EX-MACHINA
tell
we
about
it
I
love
genre
film
and
this
do
what
best
science
fiction
do
which
be
it
say
something
about
the
human
experience
this
be
a
film
about
a
inventer
that
create
essentially
a
in
the
form
of
a
female
robot
Domhnall
Gleeson
be
in
it
it
be
a
study
in
what
it
be
to
be
human
and
where
we
draw
the
line
it
be
fantastic
performance
not
a
lot
of
people
see
it
as
well
I
do
not
think
let
take
a
quick
look
at
that
what
happen
to
I
and
my
family
be
it
bad
I
do
not
know
do
you
think
I
might
be
switch
off
because
I
do
not
function
as
well
as
I
be
suppose
to
I
do
not
know
in
answer
to
you
conversation
it
be
not
up
to
I
why
be
it
up
to
anyone
do
you
have
people
who
test
you
and
might
switch
you
off
no
then
why
do
I
so
what
be
it
to
be
human
right
who
be
the
human
and
who
be
the
robot
definitely
one
of
the
thing
I
love
about
it
be
it
be
a
morality
play
it
deal
with
objectification
of
woman
and
the
internet
and
thing
where
we
do
not
even
realize
we
be
give
out
information
about
ourselves
it
be
probably
one
of
the
most
thoughtful
piece
I
have
see
this
year
the
next
category
for
both
of
you
be
best
of
great
performance
Ann
you
pick
SAOIRSE
Ronan
in
Brooklyn
yes
this
be
she
as
a
young
irish
woman
fall
for
a
tough
italian
kid
I
be
italian
or
my
parent
be
anyway
be
you
do
something
italian
tonight
yeah
we
be
go
to
behave
like
Italians
what
do
that
mean
I
do
not
know
hand
too
many
of
they
could
seem
that
way
listen
I
want
everything
out
in
the
open
I
come
to
the
irish
dance
because
I
really
like
irish
girl
and
I
be
the
only
one
who
would
dance
with
you
it
be
not
--
oh
you
dance
with
other
you
see
something
like
that
be
it
a
new
actor
breakout
performance
what
draw
you
to
that
it
be
definitely
a
breakout
performance
with
she
I
have
see
she
before
she
be
in
the
movie
atonement
and
I
think
that
be
probably
the
first
time
she
come
to
my
attention
and
I
have
be
a
fan
ever
since
but
this
be
truly
a
transcendent
performance
for
she
a
young
Iran
woman
come
to
America
similar
to
spotlight
it
be
a
little
restrained
it
be
a
little
old
fashion
it
be
a
little
edgy
not
a
ounce
of
cynicism
in
it
but
also
not
a
ounce
of
cheap
sentiment
in
it
either
the
way
she
hold
the
camera
and
audience
attention
as
a
young
woman
transform
before
we
eye
from
this
young
country
girl
to
a
woman
of
the
city
and
a
american
and
a
woman
of
the
future
it
be
all
in
she
face
it
be
a
extraordinary
physical
performance
you
be
do
quieter
film
maybe
it
be
because
I
be
get
old
Mark
you
choose
Tom
hardy
in
two
great
film
actually
three
this
year
tell
I
I
know
legend
and
the
revenue
and
also
mad
max
which
be
a
great
film
this
year
we
have
a
little
clip
from
legend
where
he
be
play
both
of
the
famous
criminal
twin
the
Kray
brother
unbelievable
I
have
get
this
it
be
fine
he
be
get
this
a
big
boy
we
be
talk
about
living
we
be
talk
about
be
gangster
right
which
be
what
we
be
so
you
can
one
of
these
case
kray
you
life
will
swallow
you
whole
Mark
tell
we
about
Tom
hardy
why
do
you
like
he
Tom
hardy
be
really
come
into
he
own
he
be
get
a
lot
of
role
we
first
see
he
in
inception
and
he
kind
of
steal
the
picture
away
from
Leonardo
DiCaprio
he
play
both
the
Kray
Brothers
one
a
soft-spoken
gentleman
the
other
be
a
brutal
killer
one
straight
the
other
homosexual
and
he
really
create
two
very
separate
character
you
completely
believe
there
be
two
people
in
the
room
and
he
accent
a
lot
of
time
we
almost
can
not
understand
because
we
have
such
a
thick
accent
come
from
the
part
of
England
he
do
but
I
have
to
say
he
performance
be
memplezzize
and
he
be
almost
a
force
of
nature
I
think
Tom
hardy
and
he
be
go
to
be
win
a
Oscar
sometime
soon
one
more
category
Mike
I
will
let
you
start
there
be
one
this
be
sort
of
the
underappreciated
or
the
film
you
would
love
to
tell
people
about
that
they
should
see
that
they
might
have
miss
again
these
be
my
taste
so
I
can
not
say
it
be
one
of
my
favorite
film
but
I
do
not
know
if
it
be
the
best
it
be
one
of
my
favorite
it
be
call
age
of
Adaline
about
a
woman
who
be
accidentally
give
the
ability
to
not
age
it
be
also
get
a
great
supportive
performance
from
Harrison
Ford
who
I
think
really
sell
it
and
this
be
a
really
well-done
film
a
film
that
could
have
fall
apart
many
time
but
for
I
keep
a
internal
logic
I
care
about
the
character
the
performance
be
great
and
I
be
never
a
blake
lively
fan
to
begin
with
but
I
think
this
be
a
really
good
film
Ann
what
be
you
underappreciated
film
of
the
year
my
underappreciated
film
be
love
and
mercy
a
beautiful
film
about
Brian
Wilson
and
the
beach
boy
instead
where
spotlight
be
storytelling
this
be
almost
straightforward
John
cusack
play
he
as
a
older
than
and
Paul
Dano
as
a
younger
and
the
two
chapter
toggle
back
and
forth
and
Elizabeth
bank
deliver
a
stunning
performance
as
the
woman
who
would
become
Wilson
wife
Melinda
it
be
a
beautifully-filmed
and
one
of
the
best
film
make
of
the
creative
process

to
come

2016

a
evening
to
honor
legend

of
America
award
Franklin
likeness
hang
at
the
Washington
Museum
we
be
lady
and
gentleman
and
we
be
not
overnight
star
it
be
gradual
and
for
I
I
just
try
to
keep
my
head
out
of
the
cloud
keep
my
foot
on
the
ground
the
73-year-old
Franklin
have
be
honor
for
she
jazz
rock
pop
classical
and
gospel
singing
and
be
the

and
just
the
fourth

overall
--
to

career

hot
hip
hop
song
chart
Franklin
be
no
stranger
to
Washington
perform
at
tree
lighting
inauguration
and
White
House
concert
in
2005
she
receive
the
nation
highest
civilian
honor

presidential
medal
of
freedom
this
latest
honor
guarantee
that
she
image
will
live
alongside
she
soundtrack
national
portrait
gallery
director
Kim
Sajet
say
Franklin
be
a
natural
choice
the
portrait
of
aretha
be
a
gateway
I
get
a
sense
of
she
singing
a
big
hair
moment
and
she
be
singing
but
also
she
name
be
spell
in
Capitol
letter
aretha
and
she
be
one
of
the
only
few
people
in
this
country
who
we
know
exactly
by
she
first
name
who
we
be
talk
about
she
be
a
lesson
for
all
of
we
be
smart
and
tenacious
and
have
a
dogged
determinedness
about
herself
which
I
think
many
of
we
can
admire
after
she
performance
at
the
gallery
I
sit
down
with
Franklin
--
who
be
see
worldwide
as
the
diva
the
queen
the
consummate
entertainer
how
do
you
see
yourself
the
lady
next
door
but
nobody
think
of
you
that
way
none
of
you
fan
none
of
the
people
in
that
room
tonight
they
think
of
you
as
much
more
than
that
well
no
they
do
not
see
I
in
that
setting
right
yeah
so
then
how
do
you
handle
the
weight
of
the
diva-ness
of
this
all
because
I
mean
there
be
a
little
bit
of
that
in
you
you
have
a
lot
of
flare
I
love
to
sing
it
be
just
a
natural
thing
for
I
and
in
the
span
of
a
six-decade
music
career
there
be
never
anything
else
she
want
to
do
so
be
part
of
you
you
know
always
go
to
be
Reverend
Franklin
daughter
absolutely
absolutely
I
be
a
preacher
kid
too
so
but
I
do
not
sing
quite
like
you
oh
well
we
do
not
all
sing
we
have
other
gift
yes
you
have
other
gift
I
want
to
ask
you
about
that
because
one
of
the
thing
that
come
up
with
people
who
be
immensely
successful
about
what
they
choose
be
what
bring
about
the
success
who
urge
you
or
who
do
not
stop
you
well
my
mentor
be
Clara
Ward
of
the
famous
ward
gospel
singer
of
Philadelphia
and
my
dad
be
my
coach
he
coach
I
and
just
my
natural
love
for
music
be
what
drive
I
do
you
keep
watch
of
the
young
people
who
be
huge
out
there
and
think
that
person
be
the
young
I
when
I
see
choir
the
junior
choir
but
in
each
and
every
one
of
those
case
and
tonight
too
you
devote
a
lot
of
it
to
gospel
which
I
think
surprise
some
of
the
audience
do
you
do
that
routinely
do
no
I
just
I
be
listen
to
some
of
the
cd
earlier
today
and
I
be
not
happy
with
my
opening
song
it
just
be
not
what
I
want
it
to
be
and

we
have
a
team

Holly
Williams
who
have

follow
the
fire
in

Holly
Elaine
the
Dubai
government

that
the
fire
break

the
20th

engulf
the
63-story

apparently
begin
at
around

time
you

see
the
entire
skyscraper
light
up
against
the
night
sky
now
the
Dubai
authority
say
that
they
now
have
the
fire
under
control
and
they
also
say
that
only
one
person
be
kill
by
a
heart
attack
during
the
evacuation
another
15
people
be
injure
the
cause
of
the
fire
be
still
not
know
and
eyewitness
say
the
fire
spread
very
rapidly
through
the
tower
which
be
almost
foot
tall
the
heat
be
so
intense
outside
it
be
unbelievable
and
just
people
start
to
panic
crush
each
other
try
to
get
down
the
stair
and
jump
over
railing
I
could
not
believe
how
fast
it
actually
happen
there
be
people
run
in
the
corridor
and
I
end
up
have
to
put
somebody
on
my
back
he
be
in
a
wheelchair
carry
he
down
to
the
ground
floor
but
holly
this
do
not
affect
the
new

celebration
surprisingly
Elaine
no
it
do
not
around
a
hour
after
the
fire
break
out
the
Dubai
authority
tweet
that
city
new
year
eve
celebration
would
go
ahead
as
plan
and
center
on
the
world
tallest
building
the
Burj
Khalifa
which
stand
just
a
few
hundred
yard
from
that
hotel
fire
Holly
Williams
report
tonight
Holly
thank
you
Munich
Germany
be
just
about
to
celebrate
the
new
year
when
police
get
word
of
a
terror
threat
they
clear
two
train
station
and
tell
people
to
avoid
crowd
Elizabeth
Palmer
have
more
on
new
year
in
Europe
not
even
terrorist
threat
could
keep
Europeans
from
ring
in
the
new
from
Moscow
to
Berlin
although
everywhere
security
be
heavy
especially
Paris
where
terrorist
strike
twice
this
year
there
the
defense
minister
himself
appear
with
some
of
the
soldier
on
duty
it
be
a
photo-op
design
to
reassure
both
resident
and
visitor
we
be
not
really
scared
about
it
we
want
to
enjoy
it
we
have
never
be
here
on
new
year
eve
and
it
be
magical
but
the
magic
be
scale
back
a
little
there
be
no
firework
this
year
and
the
traditional
party
on
the
Champs
Elysee
will
wrap
up
earlier
than
usual
in
Brussels
the
official
party
be
cancel
soldier
fan
out
across
the
city
and
worker
dismantle
the
stage
where
the
new
year
show
be
to
go
on
after
the
arrest
of
two
man
suspect
of
plan
holiday
attack
some
think
it
be
a
over
-
reaction
I
think
it
be
back
down
to
the
threat
of
terrorism
I
think
we
should
stand
up
and
just
make
everything
happen
but
Belgians
be
edgy
this
week
police
arrest
yet
another
suspect
with
link
to
the
Paris
attack
in
Molenbeek
a
Brussels
suburb
that
be
home
to
two
of
the
other
attacker
and
one
of
they
Saleh
Abdeslam
be
still
on
the
loose
still
new
year
eve
be
for
celebration
say
Brussels
club
owner
Pablo
Saccomano
I
really
believe
that
the
people
from
Brussels
need
to
go
out
and
party
and
need
to
gather
as
well
and
to
bond
together
and
it
be
not
only
the
belgian
police
Elaine
who
discover
evidence
of
a
new
year
terrorist
attack
the
Turks
too
have
arrest
two
man

bomb
crowd
area
in
Ankara

by
flee
the
country
I
feel
afraid
all
the
time
not
only
of
the
person
who
do
this
to
I
but
I
feel
afraid
of
the
knowledge
that
the
secret
have
power
over
I
and
over
my
life
how
do
it
manifest
itself
physically
I
mean
this
be
such
a
deep
dark
secret
and
to
think
that
you
have
it
for
14
year
I
think
be
beyond
the
comprehension
of
a
lot
of
people
out
there
right
be
you
have
headache
at
night
do
you
have
sweat
well
on
a
daily
base
I
would
have
nightmare
I
have
tremendous
stress
and
anxiety
I
do
have
frequent
headache
I
be
sort
of
experience
constant
vigilance
mostly
over
look
for
the
person
who
do
this
to
I
I
just
experience
this
second
version
of
myself
that
that
be
the
secret
that
in
reality
I
be
a
afraid
person
all
the
time
every
day
very
often
after
a
upset
experience
we
almost
go
into
this
magical
thinking
well
if
I
do
not
talk
about
it
it
will
go
away
talk
it
will
just
bring
it
back
up
because
it
be
completely
false
it
be
there
you
be
live
with
it
day
in
and
day
out
at
the
University
of
Texas
Austin
psychology
professor
Jenny
pen
Baker
have
study
secret
and
the
stress
they
bring
day
in
day
out
what
be
the
actual
physical
consequence
of
harbor
a
secret
when
they
have
a
secret
and
do
not
talk
about
it
they
be
at
greater
risk
for
health
problem
higher
risk
for
blood
pressure
for
immune
problem
increase
rate
of
cold
flus
there
be
some
evidence
that
it
have
a
higher
progression
of
cancer
all
of
these
be
marking
of
a
body
under
stress
when
soldier
return
from
war
they
too
often
carry
a
hidden
burden
have
do
a
lot
of
work
with
soldier
who
have
be
involve
in
horrible
thing
who
have
see
horrible
thing
who
have
do
horrible
thing
that
they
be
again
live
with
these
and
most
of
they
they
can
not
talk
to
anybody
about
it
they
really
believe
that
nobody
else
understand
in
he
research
he
have
find
something
that
help
veteran
and
other
with
the
trauma
in
they
past
write
the
soldier
who
write
expressively
voice
deep
thought
as
oppose
to
write
factually
or
not
at
all
show
deduction
in
illness
and
anger
and
be
more
likely
to
hold
job
the
basic
idea
be
that
when
people
put
upset
experience
into
word
it
help
to
organize
they
it
help
to
put
these
experience
into
some
kind
of
meaningful
framework
and
very
often
these
people
be
deal
with
these
major
upsetling
experience
that
they
can
not
talk
to
they
spouse
about
they
can
not
talk
to
they
kid
about
why
do
that
write
help
people
leal
from
traumatic
experience
that
they
have
have
this
be
the
$
question
we
know
that
there
be
certain
aspect
that
underlie
one
be
just
the
mere
acknowledgment
of
a
experience
seem
to
have
a
effect
the
labeling
of
this
happen
writing
have
work
with
inmate
and
college
student
in
we
lab
we
have
see
everything
we
have
see
murder
you
have
see
murder
yeah
we
have
see
war
atrocity
we
have
see
victim
of
rape
we
have
see
people
with
suicide
attempt
you
name
it
it
be
remarkable
the
thing
that
we
have
see
the
murder
for
example
be
among
maximum
security
prisoner
in
a
project
we
do
several
year
ago
that
sound
perfect
very
good
a
doctor
be
a
regular
at
a
write
workshop
in
Methodist
that
help
employee
there
put
they
sometimes
stressful
experience
at
the
hospital
into
word
for
I
it
be
a
real
shock
you
start
question
everything
that
be
be
say
before
when
you
be
take
care
of
patient
you
be
the
sponge
for
all
of
they
problem
and
they
problem
could
be
medical
physical
but
they
can
also
be
emotional
maybe
other
people
in
they
family
be
sick
and
when
you
say
for
example
see
20
patient
a
day
that
be
20
people
problem
that
you
be
absorb
and
in
a
textbook
it
say
you
might
let
go
at
but
I
would
say
most
people
do
not
let
go
of
that
at
so
little
stressful
that
make
it
very
interesting
for
I
I
think
when
you
spend
time
write
you
get
to
the
essence
of
it
make
time
to
think
and
to
reflect
on
something
be
really
really
important
you
do
not
even
need
to
actually
share
you
secret
with
anyone
to
see
a
benefit
you
can
simply
write
it
down
and
rip
it
up
be
there
a
difference
between
write
a
secret
down
and
maybe
toss
that
paper
away
and
unburden
yourself
to
a
wife
or
to
a
friend
I
think
they
both
can
be
beneficial
the
one
difference
be
write
it
for
yourself
and
throw
it
away
you
know
be
safe
there
be
no
repercussion
for
do
that
this
be
a
big
danger
if
you
now
tell
you
friend
or
you
wife
or
somebody
else
there
be
a
chance
that
they
will
be
outraged
that
it
could
influence
you
relationship
with
that
person
perhaps
forever

declare
because
of
that
violence
which
leave
more
than
70

hope
decriminalization
will
put
a
end
to
the
violence
and
shift

away
from

year
he
have
practice
the

and
compare
it
to
the
use
of
bread
and
wine
in

I
know
people
who
eat
it
and
drink
it
who
make
product
out
of
it
it
have
become
a
integral
part
of

remember
many
time
when
he
go
to

not
only
be
it
no
longer
criminal
but
many
see
a
opportunity
to
capitalize
on
the
multi-billion

industry
with
what
already
be
a
homegrown
international
brand
he
be
the
head
of
the
grower
association
and
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
that
may
come
I
be
say
you
come
with
you
money
and
you
facility
these
root
be
here
they
will
grow
but
we
do
not
only
want
they
to
grow
we
want
youth
to
come
and
learn
the
science
of
marijuana
so
one
day
they
can
come
and
have
they
own
business
in
other
word
that
can
help
at

we
meet
hope
to
cash
in
on

green
rush
there
be
a
entrepreneur
look
to
launch
a
new

what
be
this
place
where
be
we
we
be
in

state-of-the-art
spice
and
seasoning
factory
Maurice

he
hope
to
one
day
in
fuse
with

ganga
why
do
you
think
you
spice
will
be
extra
better
than
official
just
recently
we
find
when
we
blend
pepper
we
local
pepper
here
with
cannabis
cannabis
oil
and
you
consume
it
the
pepper
open
the
gland
and
taste
bud
and
you
receive
you
medication
much
better
when
you
look
around
how
much
opportunity
do
you
see
and
have
oh
it
be
bud
with
excitement
pun
intend
bud
excitement
Ellis
say
no
one
would
invest
in
he
spice
business
until
he
introduce
the
idea
of
add
medicinal
ganga
to
he
product
that
be
when
he
get
investor
from
all
over
the

include
a
investor
from
California

be
test
here
that
be
not
in
the
you
look
at
this
as
a
opportunity
opportunity
for
business
as
a
american
it
be
wonderful
because
the
government
here
of
Jamaica
be
go
to
allow
what
the
government
have
not
do
and
that
be
allow
for
we
to
do

live
study
which
be
phenomenal
advocate
think
legalization
could
give
Jamaica
struggle
economy
a
boost
my
concern
be
what
people
benefit
from
this
medical
marijuana

will
it
be
the

I
sure
have
a

on

when

blood
clot
what
about
my

my

what
if

happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in

I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less

both
make
switching
to

the

NBC
News
uncover
a
medical
device
associate
with
over
2
dozen
death
now
we
learn
a
supposedly
improve
version
have
potentially
fatal
flaw
of
its
own
also
the
incredible
spectacles
from
part
of
the
world
where
it
be
already
2016
now
a
follow-up
on
a
exclusive
NBC
News
Investigation
into
a
medical
device
design
to
prevent
blood
clot
from
reach
the
heart
and
lung
but
be
associate
with
at
least
27
death
the
company
modify
the
device
and
a
new
version
be
suppose
to
solve
its
problem
as
Stephanie
Gosk
report
the
new
device
have
similar
problem
and
be
associate
with
at
least
a
dozen
more
death
when
Chris
doctor
tell
he
five
year
ago
he
need
a
blood
clot
filter
to
help
treat
a
genetic
disorder
he
do
not
think
twice
it
be
here
to
save
you
life
so
I
say
okay
let
do
it
the
filter
be
a
small
wire
trap
insert
in
the
largest
vein
in
the
body
to
prevent
deadly
blood
clot
from
travel
to
the
heart
and
lung
more
than
a
quarter
million
be
implant
every
year
without
incident
it
be
make
by
g2
express
in
October
a
routine
check-up
reveal
something
alarming
the
filter
be
not
where
it
be
suppose
to
be
he
say
it
be
dangerously
close
to
you
heart
he
have
speak
to
other
surgeon
and
none
would
attempt
to
remove
this
they
turn
to
William
Coe
he
specialize
in
remove
these
filter
during
this
emergency
surgery
he
see
two
already
damage
filter
leg
break
off
one
could
have
kill
Chris
it
float
in
front
of
we
eye
literally
burst
into
the
right
atrium
and
then
into
the
right
ventricle
he
be
lucky
that
do
not
pierce
he
heart
right
he
see
more
complication
with
Bard
filter
than
any
other
brand
and
stop
use
they
all
together
this
be
not
the
first
time
there
have
be
concern
about
a
bard
filter
the
g2
implant
in
Chris
be
suppose
to
be
safer
than
the
original
version
call
the
recovery
we
turn
to
a
NBC
News
Investigation
we
have
be
work
on
for
a
year
a
NBC
News
Investigation
earlier
this
year
show
the
company
know
the
recovery
have
potentially
fatal
flaw
we
investigation
uncovered
confidential
company
document
that
show
the
recovery
filter
have
higher
rate
of
relative
risk
for
death
filter
fracture
and
movement
than
all
of
its
competitor
accord
to
the
FDA
and
company
record
the
recovery
device
be
now
associate
with
at
least
27
death
instead
of
recall
the
problematic
recovery
they
keep
sell
the
filter
until
it
could
market
the
replacement
g2
which
the
company
hope
would
resolve
its
issue
but
accord
to
they
own
internal
record
it
do
not
document
from
Bard
and
the
FDA
show
that
the
replacement
g2
series
filter
have
more
report
problem
than
any
of
they
competitor
in
a
confidential
memo
one
of
Bard
own
vice
president
express
concern
with
problem
with
migration
tilt
and
perforation
be
the
g2
safe
for
patient
I
think
the
datum
speak
for
itself
the
number
of
complication
the
frequency
of
the
failure
make
it
obvious
that
it
be
never
safe
to
be
implant
he
say
both
the
g2s
and
its
predecessor
the
recovery
should
have
be
recall
they
be
not
Bard
keep
the
g2
on
the
market
five
year
and
sell
at
least
12
death
have
be
associate
with
the
filter
what
we
learn
the
hard
way
be
that
we
can
no
longer
rely
on
the
medical
device
company
to
do
what
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient
and
we
can
no
longer
rely
on
the
FDA
to
properly
regulate
these
device
we
first
report
on
Bard
filter
prompt
the
chairman
of
the
Senate
Judiciary
Committee
Charles
Grassley
to
send
this
letter
to
the
FDA
ask
in
part
what
action
the
FDA
take
when
new
information
about
a
approve
medical
device
come
know
FDA
only
get
one
responsibility
it
be
not
the
company
it
be
John
Public
to
protect
the
american
public
from
safety
and
effectiveness
Senator
Grassley
tell
we
the
FDA
response
be
incomplete
he
have
more
question
as
he
decide
what
step
to
take
next
once
again
Bard
decline
we
request
for
a
on-camera
interview
but
tell
we
while
all
medical
device
carry
some
risk
its
filter
be
a
important
clinical
option
for
physician
and
that
the
company
steadfastly
believe
in
the
safety
and
efficacy
of
these
device
we
be
lucky
we
get
the
bulk
of
that
filter
out
four
day
after
Chris
emergency
surgery
he
meet
with
Coe
for
a
follow-up
this
be
a
filter
we
remove
one
of
the
break
arm
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
jar
a
patient
grateful
to
be
save
from
a
filter
he
think
be
save
he
life
you
seem
shake
to
I
it
be
very
difficult
to
think
that
you
could
have
miss
it
you
catch
it
luckily
the
FDA
do
not
answer
we
question
why
Bard
recovery
and
g2
filter
be
not
recall
the
agency
say
it
investigate
the
risk
of
all
blood
clot
filter
not
just
Bard
and
issue
safety
alert
the
agency
help
organize
a
outside
long-term
clinical
trial
that
begin
this
month
to
examine
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
filter
on
the
market

from

the
rebel
patriotic
front
which
be
the
Rwandan
army
defeat
those
involve
those
killing
by
rtf
troops
be
in
no
way
critical
of
the
genocide
nevertheless
they
be
crime
against
humanity
fall
within
the
remit
of
the
icr
Snoop
they
deny
it
and
say
they
bring
they
soldier
to
justice
at
home
I
do
not
believe
both
side
should
counter
in
the
question
of
the
I
believe
they
have
enough
job
to
do
the
government
criticize
it
for
be
slow
and
expensive
there
be
many
on
the
run
if
they
be
catch
they
will
have
to
be
try
elsewhere
he
may
be
pride
here
but
only
if

he
they
want

group
say
the
trial
be
fair
the
killing
lead
to
a

I
r
be
unprecedented
and
bring
justice
to
some
of
the
victim
of
one
of
the
worst
atrocity
of
the
20th
century
joiven
I
now
be
Mork
Kerrs
ten
a
international
justice
researcher
in
Toronto
the
tribunal
close
after
21
year
it
be
a
long
time
be
the
job
do
that
be
a
good
question
Justice
be
never
really
do
there
will
be
excess
of
justice
unresolved
issue
there
be
a
number
of
perpetrator
who
have
not
be
bring
to
the
court
there
be
those
issue
there
be
other
issue
crime
perpetrate
by
other
arrangement
during
the
Rwanda
genocide
and
it
be
unclear
whether
those
people
will
face
justice
Justice
be
in
a
sense
never
truly
do
to
its
fullest
extend
I
think
after
21
year
consider
there
be
only
93
individual
indict
2
billion
spend
on
this
how
can
you
sigh
it
be
success
judge
decide
rape
be
a
act
of
genocide
and
it
change
the
way
which
thiven
use
rape
as
a
spoil
of
war
set
a
important
precedent
the
tribunal
should
consider
it
a
success
that
prosecute
individual
it
be
not
just
instigate
and
perpetrate
by
people
with
machete
and
gun
but
the
people
in
the
media
that
organize
part
of
the
genocide
create
a
frenzy
that
people
should
kill
each
other
and
toot
sis
they
have
to
be
bring
into
act
there
be
valid
criticism
of
the
tribunal
and
its
posteriored
here
even
though
a
billion
or
whatever
it
may
be
be
spend
on
the
tribunal
we
need
to
think
about
cost
in
relative
term
I
be
look
it
up
the
yearly
budget
be
about
the
same
as
the
payroll
there
be
a
difference
between
the
for
profit
sport
league
there
be
anger
within
a
lot
of
rwandan
that
after
20
year
only
a
few
thousand
be
convict
you
can
see
why
there
be
anger
people
expectation
about
how
efficient
the
process
and
tribal
need
be
not
meet
I
think
the
cost
issue
should
be
consider
relative
to
other
cost
the
fact
that
the
expectation
-
maybe
it
be
not
a
issue
of
success
it
be
how
difficult
it
be
for
the
tribunal
to
do
the
work
they
be
attempt
to
do
do
you
feel
the
counter
rwandan
president
should
have
be
prosecute
I
do
not
think
I
be
in
a
position
to
say
that
intiff
you
will
under
the
Rue
Wand
Jan
patriotic
front
be
indicate
in
mass
atrocity
no
one
be
suggest
that
we
should
equate
they
with
what
happen
with
regard
there
be
ample
evidence
to
suggest
that
this
type
of
tribunal
should
have
open
prosecution
into
individual
ally
with
Paul
and
the
rpf
that
lead
to
a
claim
of
justice
not
a
single
rpf
official
have
be
prosecute

you

much

let
I
start
with
Bolling
actually
you
have
a
better
chart
than
most
of
the

so
I
think
we
should
start
with
bolling
and
work
we
way
you
have
remarkable
ability
for
communication
especially
write
I
be
hope
--

have
Jupiter
in

about

be
so
rare

lot
she
should
be
you
run
mate
there
you
go
she
will
take
over
later
after
you
get
do
we
have
the
plan
here
really
Kimberly
you
be
a
pice
you
be
go
to
come
into
so
much
money
in
the
second
half
of
the

I
like
this
show
mama
the
money
a
little
pice
be
do
well
with
marriage
who
have
the
best
chart
of
the
candidate
well
--
I
do
not
mean
to
interrupt
the
money
thing
we
will
get
back
to
that
Trump
have
a
great
chart
he
be
a
brilliant
communicator
very
much
of
a
maverick
so
he
be
never
go
to
do
thing
the
way
everybody
else
he
have
the
moon
in
Sagittarius
he
tell
the
truth
do
you
happen
to
--
he
have
trouble
with
woman
do
you
run
Hillary
Clinton
chart
I
do
and
look
it
be
never
predestine
you
know
what
I
mean
we
have
to
vote
we
can
not
just
go
to
sleep
and
find
out
who
win
we
have
to
vote
but
she
constituency
be
solid
they
do
not
waiver
they
love
she
and
they
be
go
to
stay
with
she
it
will
be
very
hard
to
pull
people
away
from
she
Marco
Rubio
actually
have
a
pretty
good
chart
so
do
Ted
Cruz
those
two
I
do
not
think
Carson
--
I
think
he
will
go
back
to
the
operating
room
at
least
--
we
can
ask
he
about
that
if
Trump
do
not
make
it
to
the
--
the
caucus
be
--
it
be
so
complicated
he

where
she
a

side
be
you

to
sacrifice
a
lot
19-year-old
model
have
be
pursue
the
dream
since

many
of

just
$
9
a
hour
we
have
long
hour
you

we
be
lift
a
lot
it
be
hard
work
but
bad
pay
be
not
the
only
down
side
there
be
also
often
the
unhealthy
pursuit
of

be
compare
to

all
the
time
you

about

anyone
who
be

and
hold
on
a

they
can
not
make
that
could
be
someone
charge
with
shoplifting
and
it
be
very
frequently
someone
charge
with
homicide
unlike
prison
where
all
inmate
have
be
convict
and

most
jail
inmate
have
only
be
charge
with
crime
and
be
innocent

key
to
that

just
about
dinnertime

be
JA-NORRIS
Hayes
he
be
about
to
be
attack
by
a
detainee
with
a
weapon
a
sock
load
with
battery
I
allow
he
to
strike
the
victim
while
provide
distance
so
the
victim
can
not
strike
back
fortunately
for
Hayes
he
be
able
to
deflect
the
initial
attack
and
what
happen
be
Hayes
gain
the
upper
hand
in
this
fight
though
this
start
as
he
be
the
victim
of
a
assault
he
quickly
become
a
participant
in
a
altercation
the
officer
continue
to
observe
the
scene
and
wait
the
arrival
of
we
response
team
you
see
Hayes
now
have
gain
the
upper
hand
in
this
altercation
and
as
the
response
team
come
in
you
see
they
secure
the
participant
fairly
quickly
efficiently
and
they
will
be
head
off

d-board
that
be
what
happen
deputy
will
question
the
other
inmate
who
have
ask
not

then
member
of
the
jail
disciplinary
board
will
determine

so
we

do

swing
the
sock
at
you
what
do
you
do
then
I
block
it
and
rush

right
I
end
up
on

of
he
and
that
be
it
when
you
end
up

of

be
you
punch
into

that
be
where
the
problem
be
it
be
good

a
point
in

it

but
because
I

since
we

have
access
you

full
access
anyway
to

color
pencil
anything
like
that
so
you
have
get
to
get
creative
so
what
we
do
be
take
a
tampon
and
any
white
deodorant
take
it
in
either
a
magazine
or
a
newspaper
and
rub
it
on
the
color
magazine
work
a
little
better
they

frequently
so
you
make
due
different
stencil
I
get
letter
stuff
like
that
I
make
stationery
for
my
mom
my
son
my
nanna
pretty
much
anybody
that
I

usually
get
some
sort
of
you

design
speak
to
she
mother
and
son
by

once
a

all
you
can
see
be
like
this
much
everything
be
all

up
you
can
see
he
be
so
red
you
can
tell
he

I

Cleveland

I
be
a
little
disappointed
that

I
feel
like

we
city
and
it
should
be
more
people
out
here
that
feel
the
same
we
we
do
we

everything
be
very
peaceful
they
do
mention
though
that
they
will
be

tomorrow
morning
at
the
Justice
Center
they
say
they
plan
to
shut
the
city
down
until
they
get
justice
for
Tamir
we
be
live
back
to
you
some
of
the
marchers
be
try
to
get
to
the
q
where
the
Trans
Siberia
Orchestra
be
perform
but
police
be
able
to
block
they
way
and
keep
the
concert
goer
safe
it
take
we
a
half
hour
to
get
here
so
it
be
quite
a
long
wait
but
worth
it
to
be
here
tonight
definitely
worth
it
it
be
my
first
time
ever
see
they
concert
goer
say
the
traffic
slow
they
down
a
little
bit
but
do
not
see
protesterse
outside
of
the
q
tonight
many
civil
rights
group
be
not
happy
with
the
grand
jury
decision
not
to
press
charge
against
the
officer
and
that
include
Jeff
Johnson
today
he
drop
off
a
letter
at
City
Hall
call
the
shooting
negligent
homicide
we
believe
that
there
be
evidence
there
and
the
video
and
the
expert
opinion
that
will
give
we
probable
cause
but
there
be
many
legal
question
surround
this
request
Dan
be
here
to
explain
how
it
could
work
and
what
kind
of
punishment
the
officer
would
receive
Tony
it
be
really
go
to
focus
around
the
theme
homicide
that
be
a
misdemeanor
that
be
really
where
this
start
as
we
have
see
with
the
grand
jury
and
as
we
watch
prosecutor
mcginty
they
decide
in
common
plea
court
where
murder
and
the
most
serious
offens
go
to
common
plea
court
we
have
see
they
come
back
and
say
there
will
be
no
charge
here
because
this
crime
happen
in
the
city
and
because
it
happen
on
city
property
with
the
city
employee
that
it
be
now
time
to
come
over
to
the
municipal
court
ISTHAT
be
a
court
that
handle
all
misdemeanor
and
if
we
hit
they
with
a
misdemeanor
and
in
fact
the
level
1
misdemeanor
the
most
serious
of
negligent
homicide
he
say
they
should
be
try
in
municipal
court
on
that
charge
and
when
I
speak
with
he
on
the
phone
earlier
I
say
where
be
you
get
this
and
why
do
you
think
they
should
be
responsible
for
this
he
say
it
be
because
of
the
way
they
handle
the
situation
the
way
they
approach
Tamir
make
it
a
negligent
situation
and
they
do
not
follow
they
training
so
they
should
be
charge
let
talk
about
the
misdemeanor
charge
even
if
--
and
this
would
be
unprecedented
but
even
if
the
city
law
director
decide
to
walk
foo
municipal
court
and
try
to
charge
they
with
negligent
homicide
and
if
they
be
find
guilty
it
be
still
only
punishable
by
six
month
in
city
jail
so
this
be
a
big
step
backwards
and
a
big
leap
when
it
come
to
Leal
--
legal
community
whether
or
not
this
could
actually
happen

the
lakeshore
and
east
of
Cleveland
a
little
lake
and
snow
will
be
develop
34
now
and
note
the
colder
stuff
up
here
in
Minnesota
21
Minneapolis
27
Chicago
this
be
slowly
come
in
the
coldest
day
be
new
year
day
I
say
cold
but
chilly
I
be
not
use
frigid
brutal
polar
vortex
you
will
not
hear
that
right
now
like
we
be
talk
about
last
year
flurry
be
in
the
forecast
cloudy
sky
and
that
be
pretty
mild
for
this
time
of
year
29
the
low
here
be
we
have
the
West
wind
set
up
and
there
be
enough
moisture
in
place
we
will
get
lake
affect
snow
go
from

say
Ashtebula
cony
too
it
be
main
--
county

be
what
the
latest

model
be
say
perhaps
a
break
late

not
go

bad
in
fact
by
tomorrow
evening
this
latest
model
have
most
of
the
snow
concentrate
around
Erie
Pennsylvania
future
view
snowfall

a
inch

less

the
biggest

Richard
be
also
lose
a
dark
secret
I
be
here
because
I
be
fat
it
be
just
the
way
it
be
I
be
a
pretty
bright
guy
if
I
do
not
want
to
be
fat
I
would
not
be
fat
so
why
do
I
want
to
be
fat
that
be
my
journey
the
314-pound
hatch
be
now
reveal
why
he
spend
so
much
of
he
time
nude
it
come
from
a
very
dark
childhood
he
say
quote
I
be
rape
at
8
molest
at
10
at
some
point
I
decide
what
people
think
of
my
body
do
not
matter
right
now
he
have
no
plan
on
the
biggest
loser
to
repeat
he
survivor
strategy
but
he
tell
we
he
abrasive
reality
star
have
lead
to
a
bull
eye
on
he
back
I
just
play
the
game
by
the
rule
but
I
do
not
think
people
understand
the
rule
so
I
get
the
reputation
of
be
something
that
I
be
really
not
that
be
okay
people
can
perceive
I
in
any
way
they
choose
obesity
be

seven
other
team
of

something
that
concern
hatch
who
be
use
to
be
a
bit
of
a
loner
I
be
not
really
social
on
the
other
hand
I
think
people
be
also
kind
of
get
to
learn
that
I
be
not
a
beast
I
be
just
I
that
be
just
who
I
be
it
be
not
a
negative
thing
I
be
here
for
I
maybe
we
will
see
the
softer
side
of
Richard
internally
not
the
external
enough
of
that
come
up
we
welcome
back
a
classic
how
the
king

via

from
Los

happy
new
year
how
in
this
day
and
age
a
modern
skyscraper
can
camp
on
fire
like
that
you
have
different
building
material
that
should
be
process
through
the
local
apartment
there
should
be
process
of
the
material
in
building
where
they
be
test
do
you
get
the
impression
that
be
not
happen
here
look
at
the
fire
and
the
one
in
February
happen
at
the
torch
they
be
similar
in
nature
they
have
similar
fire
and
spread
to
the
base
of
the
building
up
to
the
top
of
the
building
this
one
look
like
it
do
the
same
thing
start
low
at
the
bottom
of
the
building
work
up
30-40
floor
wherever
it
wind
up
I
think
the
assumption
for
a
lot
of
people
be
the
large
new
high-rise
have
sprinkler
system
baton
down
flame
that
pop
up
I
can
not
expret
enough
the
importance
of
sprinkler
and
building
that
be
a
important
part
of
it
the
concern
be
more
of
wrapping
of
the
building
the
insulation
that
be
put
on
the
building
allow
for
energy
efficiency
there
be
a
issue
with
the
cover
and
surface
that
it
be
question
here
you
do
believe
report
that
there
be
system
in
the
high-rise
I
be
certain
that
be
the
case
possibly
fatality
for
have
a
building
of
this
size
and
the
number
of
people
injure
I
think
the
sprinkler
system
be
a
major
factor
in
save
the
life
and
the
property
at
least
the
interior
portion
of
the
building
if
you
look
at
the
picture
it
be
a
incredible
fire
and
surprising
to
a
lot
of
people
GORT
nately
that
no
one
be
seriously
hurt
be
you
surprise
as
well
sprinkler
system
know
most
of
the
building
be
build
be
protect
it
be
really
not
at
surprise
the
number
injure
what
be
surprising
be
how
about
material
be
store
it
be
something
that
need
to
be
revisit
have
you
notice
between
United
States
and
consider
this
be
a
global
city
the
difference
Dubai
I
believe
be
advance
it
be
surprising
to
I
be
the
United
States
be
a
enforcer
for
the
last
17
year
of
my
career
it
be
interesting
that
Dubai
skip
this
step
I
be
not
sure
I
can
not
say
first
hand
what
be
go
on
definitely
it
be
a
larger
fire
than
it
should
have

I
need
to
work
so
when
you

a
chance
that
this
75-year-old
could
be
the
little
dot
of
a

not
want
to
penalize

with
that
be
say
there
be
a
new
rule
I
will
not
go

that
particular
neighborhood
at
that
time
of

he
have
two
tip
for
Uber

a
little
bit
more
to
go
we
be
go
to
be
wrap
up
2015
and
start
2016
just
about
how
you
think
we
should
be
as
far
as
the
weather
go
a
little
bit
of
Lake
effect
snow
especially
east
of
Cleveland
cloudy
sky
otherwise
temperature
in
the
low
30s
as
we
get
we
day
go
in
the
morning
as
far
as
where
we
stand
right
now
we
have
be
deal
with
patchy
drizzle
a
little
bit
of
snow
here
and
there
throughout
the
evening
and
we
be
still
deal
with
patchy
drizzle
most
of
this
be
still
come
down
as
liquid
not
freezing
on
contact
it
be
not
officially
freezing
drizzle
because
the
temperature
be
above
freezing
where
it
be
take
place
be
you
follow
I
temperature
West
though
be
below
freezing
and
if
indeed
we
continue
to
have
this
patchy
drizzle
as
the
temperature
fall
off
we
could
have
some
of
the
drizzle
freezing
on
elevated
surface
like
windshield
that
be
never
good
bridge
and
overpass
and
possibly
porch
and
step
and
whatnot
around
you
home
just
keep
that
in
mind
for
tomorrow
morning
we
have
a
definite
trend
toward
cooler
temperature
that
be
continue
to
sink
southward
over
the
western
United
States
this
have
be
in
place
the
core
of
the
nasty
cold
air
be
go
to
stay
north
of
US
ft
we
do
not
have
to
worry
about
that
but
we
will
be
feel
a
lot
colder
a
big
area
of
high
pressure
in
the
western
part
of
the
country
be
really
the
dominate
weather
feature
all
of
that
rain
that
you
see
there
in
New
York
a
couple
of
minute
ago
on
the
video
and
then
you
probably
be
hear
about
the
flooding
in
the
Carolinas
back
into
Missouri
that
storm
system
be
continue
to
progress
eastward
and
we
be
really
not
under
the
area
of
high
pressure
yet
we
be
have
these
little
wave
of
weak
low
pressure
trough
move
through
wave
of
energy
and
that
be
just
enough
to
keep
the
cloud
in
place
and
keep
stirg
up
chance
for
shower
--
stir
up
chance
for
shower
here
and
there
the
last
day
of
2015
we
will
start
in
the
low
30
and
upper
20
by
midday
in
the
low
30
and
probably
top
out
in
the
mid
30
for
the
day
tomorrow
that
be
right
on
par
for
average
for
this
time
of
the
year
and
the
lake
effect
snow
shower
will
be
accompany
the
cooler
area
you
can
see
the
westerly
wind
be
drive
the
lake
snow
out
into
Lake
Geauga
Ashtabula
County
maybe
a
inch
if
we
can
get
the
snow
shower
to
hold
it
look
like
for
the
most
part
Thursday
night
into
Friday
if
we
can
that
Lake
Snow
to
continue
a
couple
of
inch
of
snow
in
Ashtabula
County
the
rest
of
we
deal
with
cloudy
sky
another
ho-hum
day
come
around
out
and
about
for
you
new
year
eve
plan
for
the
evening
temperature
in
the
upper
20s
and
low
30
right
about
midnight
mid
30
for
the
day
tomorrow
what
be
left
of
we
little
wintery
mix
get
the
snow
shower
go
as
well
and
the
new
year
eve
forecast
midnight
hour
do
look
like
the
temperature
be
go
to
be
right
about
the
30-degree
mark
in
much
of
northern
Ohio
as
far
as
the
window
nation
7-day
noeshg
go
you
can
see
as
we
get
into
the
first
weekend
of
2016
cloud
around
pretty
ho-hum
and
then
next
week
we
will
hopefully
get
more
glimpse
of
sun
by
Tuesday
and
Wednesday
as
we
warm
back
up
okay
thanks
Betsy
well
come
up
this
season
appear
to
be
over
for
Johnny
Manziel
after
learn
today
he
have
a
concussion
the
brown
will
play
they
final
game
of
the
season
this
Sunday
against
the
steeler
at
the
stadium
and
it
look
like
they
will
do
it
without
Johnny
Manziel
because
manziel
be
currently
in
the
concussion
protocol
they
will
have
to
be
clear
to
play
this
Sunday
and
that
be
look
very
unlikely
at
this
point
the
14th
brown
to
suffer
a
concussion
this
season
I
know
that
number
have
be
high
in
Cleveland
even
go
back
a
couple
of
year
that
be
point
out
in
a
report
not
too
long
ago
that
we
training
staff
be
r
already
look
at
those
and
pull
individual
clip
and
you
know
hopefully
we
will
have
better
answer
as
to
the
why
as
the
off-season
move
on
so
it
appear
that
manziel
season
be
over
what
kind
of
year
have
it
be
for
the
2012
heisman
winner
on
the
field
for
the
brown
cleated
58
%
--
complete
58
%
of
he
pass
and
5
interception
at
this
point
we
still
do
not
know
for
sure
if
Johnny
Manziel
can
be
a
consistent
starter
or
not
in
the
NFL
but
he
have
definitely
show
improvement
from
last
year
he
be
continue
to
grow
but
I
think
there
be
a
lot
of
--
a
lot
of
good
thing
to
draw
on
from
this
year
for
he
and
just
because
this
be
--
it
be
a
tough
position
to
play
but
I
think
he
be
take
the
right
step
and
do
a
heck
of
a
job
so
in
the
likely
event
manziel
be
not
clear
to
play
against
the
steeler
on
Sunday
Austin
Davis
would
get
the
start
at
quarterback
for
the
second
time
this
year
if
that
happen
it
would
be
the
fourth
consecutive
season
that
the
brown
will
end
they
year
with
they
third
string
quarterback
let
go
to
Ohio
State
in
Glendale
Arizona
get
ready
for
the
fiesta
bowl
against
Notre
Dame
the
last
game
for
Jones
in
a
Buckeye
as
uniform
he
will
enter
the
NFL
draft
this
spring
he
begin
as
the
starter
for
the
buck
and
lose
the
starter
he
throw
for
1460
yard
8
touchdown
and
5
interception
now
some
would
argue
that
Braxton
Miller
be
the
most
talented
he
play
the
season
as
a
receiver
and
will
also
be
in
the
NFL
draft
this
spring
but
braxton
thought
on
he
Buckeye
career
that
will
come
to
a
end
on
new
year
day
early
you
know
play
my
year
as
quarterback
in
one
year
and
make
a
crazy
transition
to
receiver
and
I
think
I
do
everything
you
know
I
be
place
to
do
when
I
come
to
Ohio
state
let
check
the
local
team
in
college
basketball
tonight
the
Akron
zip
take
care
of
South
Carolina
state
78-68
they
improve
to
10-2
on
the
season
and
Kent
state
edge
past
North
Carolina
61-60
to
improve
8-4
on
the
campaign
the
buckeyes
open
big
ten
play
against
Minnesota
in
Columbus
they
be
lead
by
Mark
love
with
20
point
tonight
the
3-point
e
watch
this
dunk
by
--
he
finish
with
13
78-63
the
final
Ohio
state
9-5
next
up
Illinois
this
Sunday
in
Columbus
as
they
will
look
to
become
2-0
in
the
big
time
Ohio
state
a
tough
start
but
they
beat
a
tough
team
tonight
Buckeye
on
Friday
favor
by
do
you
like
that
do
that
seem
like
a
reasonable
line
I
think
so

think

beat
Notre
Dame
I
think
the
Buckeyes
Sara

begin
tell
we
what
happen
that
day
well
I
be
active
duty
air
force
at
the
time
and
drive
in
the
right-hand
lane
beyond
a
van
I
be
do
what
I
be
suppose
to
do
have
the
seatbelt
on
drive
on
the
right
a
tractor
trailer
come
it
a
stop
in
the
left
leap
and
do
not
realise
there
be
a
turn
lane
100
foot
up
because
there
be
a
grassie
median
in
the
middle
a
18
wheeler
with
a

stop
in
the
LEFT-HAND
lane
because
of
a
number
of
distraction
cell
phone
gp
s
car
window

make-up
-
I
be
not
pay
attention
-
I
do
not
know
which
one
it
be
at
the
point
of
impact
he
find
he
come
and
I
push
he
six
foot
you
be
badly
work
be
you
recovery
a
lengthy
one
yes
I
be
in
the
hospital
for
two
month
straight
immediately
follow
the
accident
and
in
a
coma
for
about
a
book
and
in
and
out
of
surgery
for
over
two
year
I
have
over
20
surgery
to
put
my
face
back
together
I
lose
my
right
eye
my
angle
be
snap
I
have
to
learn
to
walk
again
to
be
clear
you
do
not
define
distract
drive
as
nah
scproly
as
cell
phone
use
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
that
could
take
someone
eye
off
the
road
I
think
it
be
a
huge
problem
with
the
distract
campaign
that
we
want
to
talk
to
people
about
if
you
look
at
the
technology
they
be
put
into
car
with
camera
for
back
up
and
the
gp
s
in
the
dashboard
and
now
wiify
for
the
car
itself
and
you
do
not
take
into
consideration
the
thing
that
be
distraction
before
the
technology
exist
kid
in
the
back
seat
car
window
radio
it
be
unbelievable
the
distraction
that
we
be
present
with
and
that
be
in
front
of
we
and
we
be
tempt
with
when
we
be
in
the
car
every
day
at
the
same
time
we
tell
young
people
when
they
be
learn
to
drive
we
tell
they
after
they
learn
to
drive
I
be
sure
you
get
the
message
-
hammer
home
during
those
year
do
not
do
anything
but
drive
when
you
drive
yet
people
think
they
can
get
away
with
it
what
do
you
think
be
go
on
I
think
that
a
lot
of
people
especially
teens
everyone
be
guilty
of
get
the
detachment
and
think
that
it
be
just
that
girl
you
see
on
the
news
or
tv
I
be
like
that
I
mean
they
just
start
talk
about
distract
drive
when
I
have
my
accident
and
I
think
the
problem
be
that
they
really
do
not
think
that
it
can
hurt
they
it
can
touch
they
that
they
be
invincible
people
that
be
not
the
case
you
mention
the
public
service
announcement
commercial
message
when
people
be
drive
none
of
those
work
what
would
work
I
be
sure
we
think
about
that
a
lot
since
the
accident
I
think
that
be
it
be
a
matter
of
talk
about
it
and
talk
to
people
and
be
realistic
because
I
think
that
the
inspection
be
that
everybody
should
be
perfect
driver
and
the
message
a
lot
of
time
be
do
not
drive
distract
and
I
do
not
-
as
much
as
I
think
that
be
a
great
message
and
there
be
validity
to
it
I
do
not
know
how
practical
it
be
I
do
not
know
that
you
will
get
rid
of
rejection
you
have
to
approach
it
from
a
stand
point
and
ayou
have
to
have
the
distraction
you
have
to
make
realistic
choice
remain

thank
you
for
join
we

tell
we
you

be
so
much

you
investigation
you
will
arrive
safely
before
you
be
a
regulator
you
be
a
member
of
Congress
and
a
legislator
it
be
hard
to
get
state
to
act
together
on
something
like
this
it
be
and
it
take
a
national
programme
just
the
way
the
government
say
be
the
level
at
which
you
be
not
go
to
dry
a
car
mother
against
drunk-driving
work
for
decade
we
have
the
standard
we
need
the
Congress
to
say
there
have
to
be
a
national
distract
drive
programme
that
give
incentive
to
state
to
begin
to
enact
law
to
change
people
before
the
way
you
change
behaviour
be
by
continue
the
drum
beat
and
some
enforcement
there
have
to
be
enforcement
even
in
the
state
they
pass
law
police
have
so
many
other
thing
to
do
other
than
to
write
ticket
for
distract
driving
if
you
use
drunk-driving
as
a
illustration
of
a
programme
that
take
a
long
time
to
implement
the
same
thing
can
be
do
with
distract
driving
national
programme
incentive
good
law
enforcement
maybe
we
solve
the
problem
when
the
debate
be
on
to
raise

totally
be
the

that
tough
it
be
hard
to
get
the

and
that
environment
Congress
be
not
do
much
of
anything
there
be
senator
I
talk
to
that
would
like
to
introduce
legislation
set
a
guideline
and
a
enforce
policy
it
have
to
be
a
carrot
and
stick
thing
you
have
to
offer
incentive
to
enforce
the
law
that
be
what
happen
with
and
the
enforcement
of
by
state
police
and
other
I
believe
it
be
the
same
incentive
to
be
offer
to
city
and
state
and
have
to
government

aaa
we
mention
earlier
in
the
programme
that
there
be
no
national
standard
for
what
you
teach
or
how
you
teach
to
drive
do
we
ask
enough
of
young
driver
we
do
not
require
driver
education
the
good
news
about
driver
education
be
it
be
show
through
research
that
we
have
do
through
the
research
foundation
that
it
can
reduce
crash
and
reduce
citation
as
compare
to
people
that
do
not
go
through
the
programme
we
need
to
learn
the
rule
of
the
road
and
it
can
prevent
we
wheel
triple
a
have
do
fascinating
research
on
young
adult
driving
habit
what
stick
out
for
you
one
of
the
surprising
finding
be
the
degree
to
which
teens
be
get
into
crash
involve
crash
National
statistics
estimate
10
%
of
teens
involve
distract
drive
this
that
crash
the
research
that
we
roll
out
we
learn
58
%
of
crash
observe
in
the
research
involve
driver
distraction
teen
passenger
and
cellphone
be
the
culprit
they
be
interesting
the
more
kid
that
be
in

it
start
with
one
if
you
dangerous
Doubles
with
two
and
quadruple
with
three
or
more
more
dangerous
than
if
you
be

you

somewhere
absolutely
triple
a
recommend
not
more
than
one
family
member
in

have

be
good
about
put

on

hello

we
be
gon
na
talk
about
Nellie
bly
and
Elizabeth
Bisland
and
the
race
round
the
globe
what
a
race
so
Nellie
bly
be
the
fost
--
the
fost
famous
-
she
be
the
fost
famous
-
she
be
the
--
the
fost
mamous
--
she
be
the
most
famous
female
journalist
of
she
day
and
she
be
read
Jules
Verne
she
be
like
80
day
around
the
world
well
I
wonder
if
I
could
do
that
so
she
go
to
she
editor
and
she
say
not
only
do
Jules
Verne
write
a
decent
book
but
also
I
think
I
can
beat
the
time
of
80
day
around
the
world
and
you
should
pay
for
it
and
she
editor
like
all
right
gal
you
be
a
gal
and
woman
--
they
can
not
travel
by
themselves
can
you
imagine
how
much
stuff
you
be
gon
na
have
to
bring
like
curl
iron
or
a
lot
of
trunk
of
stuff
she
say
listen
editor
if
you
do
not
put
this
story
out
I
be
gon
na
go
to
a
compete
paper
so
then
the
editor
like
okay
well
if
you
put
it
that
way
you
be
leave
like
tomorrow
or
really
soon
or
something
like
that
and
there
be
a
gentleman
and
he
be
say
to
himself
well
look
at
this
newspaper
it
say
that
Nellie
bly
be
gon
na
go

well
I
own
Cosmopolitan
magazine
and
we
be
just
a
little
baby
magazine
we
have
only
be

three
year
so
like
what
if
we
also
send
a
journalist
and
then
she
go
around
the
world
and
it
be
definitely
she
because
like
fairness
he
think
of
Elizabeth
Bisland
she
be
they
literary
editor
so
she
be
mostly
know
for
literary
salon
and
just
kind
of
generally
be
hot
he
say
would
you
like
to
go
around
the
world
you
have
to
leave
tonight
and
she
be
like
well
if
my
editor
want
I
to
do
it
I
will
go

so
six
hour
after
even
learn
of
this
idea
Elizabeth

this
be
happen
she
think
she
be
race
a
fictional
character
well
it
turn
out
she
be
race
a
real

and
they
be
go

opposite
direction
so
Nellie

land
in

somebody
say
to
she
Jules

like
to

and
they
can
not
take
they
eye
off

it
they
be
follow
she
the
entire
way

I
mean
this
be
like
clickbait
stuff
meanwhile
Elizabeth

because
she
be
follow
the
wind
so
she
be
gon
na
win
Nellie
bly
be

dawdle
at
this
point
so
she
get
to
Hong

she
like

in
the
race
name
Elizabeth
Bisland
she

Pacific
but
where
Elizabeth

here
you
Turkey

they

so
Thomas
NAST
be
a
political
cartoonist
for
Harper
weekly
it
be
not
like
Garfield
it
be
like
people
take
he
seriously
okay
so
the
New

in
1871
they
be
like
hey
we

-lsb-

-rsb-
evidence
that

exciting
tradition
be
the
we
bring

the
new

if
you
be
into
stats
pound
of
fall
confetti
a
crystal
ball
and
police
officer
you
would
be
surprised
how
quickly
they
clean
it
up
I
know
they
move
very
very
quickly
move
it
out
move
in
with
those
machine
exactly
uh-huh
welcome
back
I
be
Christine
Divine
and
I
be
Bob
Decastro
a
one-year
extension
what
pilot
project
mean
to
keep
drunk
driver
off
the
street
on
new
year
eve
to
find
out
if
this
project
be
make
a
difference
I
be
probably
two
year
on
the
job
work
graveyard
shift
and
my
partner
and
I
receive
a
call
of
a
traffic
collision
with
a
big
rig
involve
California
Highway
Patrol
Officer
Edger
Figueroa
say
he
see
too
many
drunk
driver
crash
that
take
the
life
of
on
too
many
people
when
we
get
there
we
see
the
driver
and
let
passenger
be
kill
and
the
investigation
consequent
investigation
tell
we
that
they
be
drive
under
the
influence
and
they
be
come
back
from
a
club
in
Hollywood
statistics
from
the
department
of
motor
vehicle
say
each
year
a
estimate
people
die
in
California
due
to
drunken
driver
and
that
repeat
offender
account
for
roughly
a
third
of
annual
dui
conviction
the
interlock
device
pilot
program
aim
to
reduce
that
number
it
have
be
in
effect
in
four
county
include
Los
Angeles
since
2010
the
ignition
interlock
device
have
be
useful
for
the
California
highway
patrol
to
reduce
the
amount
of
Duis
and
also
traffic
collision
in
the
four
count
they
be
institute
officer
Figueroa
say
he
think
it
be
make
a
difference
so
in
my
experience
I
have
pull
people
over
for
a
traffic
violation
and
in
they
vehicle
they
do
have
interlock
ignition
device
and
because
of
that
they
be
sober
and
not
drinking
these
device
be
not
supply
by
chp
if
you
be
court
order
to
install
one
they
be
install
by
a
private
company
they
run
about
$
75
a
piece
and
a
daily
fee
so
you
can
end
up
pay
hundred
of
dollar
in
Los
Angeles
I

news
it
be
always
safer
to
call
for
a
car
service
if
you
have
have
a
few
to
drink
but
tonight
it
will
likely
cost
you
a
bit
more
ride
sharing
service
like
Uber
and
lyft
will
increase
fee
by
as
much
as
200
%
for
peek
hour
tonight
it
be
call
price
surge
Uber
and
LYFT
will
have
a
record
number
of
car
available
they
will
let
user
know
the
cost
of
the
car
beforehand
and
rider
will
have
to
accept
the
fee
if
they
want
the
ride
price
be
expect
to
be
the
highest
between
and
in
the
morning
that
make
sense
uh-huh
may
be
easy
to
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the
same
time
but
farp
more
difficult
and
dangerous
to
walk
and
text
the
term
distract
walk
can
be
deadly
in
some
case
some
startling
stats
tonight
smartphone
let
people
see
and
hear
thing
from
all
around
the
world
and
that
be
good
but
more
and
more
user
be
fail
to
see
and
hear
what
be
right
in
front
of
they
and
that
be
bad
even
deadly
expert
say
smartphone
now
be
contribute
to
this
troubling
trend
a
pedestrian
be
be
kill
every
two
hour
in
the
United
States
and
for
the
first
time
this
year
the
United
Safety
Council
list
distract
walk
as
a
section
in
they
injury
report
and
use
a
new
name
for
people
who
text
and
walk
borrow
from
the
website
urbandictionary
SMARTPHONE
technology
be
become
more
universal
everybody
actually
use
they
cell
phone
throughout
the
day
so
I
think
those
accident
will
actually
go
up
people
can
fall
into
pothole
walk
into
car
get
into
all
type
of
accident
just
last
week
a
man
in
California
walk
off
a
cliff
because
he
eye
be
on
a
device
and
not
to
the
rock
down
below
and
eight
pedestrian
be
kill
in
one
week
official
then
people
need
to
be
more
careful
you
have
to
be
alert
when
you
walk
the
busy
street
of
New
York
we
all
have
to
do
you
have
to
find
motorist
and
pedestrian
but
several
people
we
see
look
down
at
they
phone
today
say
there
be
no
big
plan
to
do
thing
differently
in
2016
still
go
to
look
at
the
phone
and
cross
the
street
the
worst
that
will
happen
be
you
run
into
somebody
else
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
biomechanic
bike
rider
sometimes
be
a
issue
it
be
a
bad
habit
really
but
especially
--
it
may
be
hard
to
stop
text
on
the
go
but
these
statistics
be
hard
to
ignore
maybe
some
people
do
not
agree
the
dangerous
of
distract
walking
or
rise
and
if
that
be
the
case
maybe
those
people
will
take
a
moment
to
look
up
the
number
mention
in
this
report
on
they
phone
in
Washington
Peter
Ducey

abomination
loom
over
you
can
you

surprised
you

I
think
this
stuff
be
too
boring
for
you
after
the
event
of
last
night
I
could
use
the
calm
that
a
dose
of
routine
drudgery
provide
what
happen
last
night
well
we
have
what
I
consider
to
be
a
promising
response
to
my
ad
so
photograph
of
the
suppose
mayhem
be
provide
a
meeting
be
set
it
be
all
go
rather
well
until
the
man
reveal
himself
to
be
a
undercover
police
officer
there
be
a
bit
of
confusion
and
some
wave
of
gun
do
you
get
arrest
the
appearance
of
a
living
kitty
do
help
my
cause
and
the
phone
call
to
captain
Gregson
secure
my
release
I
still
maintain
that
it
be
a
sound
tactic
you
can
not
judge
a
idea
just
by
the
result
it
provide
so
-lrb-
cell
phone
dinging
-rrb-
oh
damn
must
I
draw
it
out
of
you
I
meet
with
my
client
last
night
we
talk
he
get
the
wrong
impression
he
ask
I
out
for
a
date
do
you
mention
that
you
be
otherwise
involve
no
it
do
not
come
up
naturally
what
do
you
mean
naturally
I
mean
give
you
history
it
be
hardly
surprising
you
have
allow
this
to
happen
at
the
very
same
moment
that
you
relationship
with
Andrew
require
tend
effort
naturally
you
have
open
yourself
up
to
other
opportunity
much
like
a
female
baboon
broadcast
she
readiness
with
inflated
genitals
you
Watson
be
something
of
a
romantic
terrorist
romantic
terrorist
you
upbringing
push
you
towards
a
conventional
relationship
but
you
eccentric
nature
be
repulse
by
the
reality
of
such
arrangement
that
be
why
you
find
yourself
draw
to
unsuitable
partner
people
like
my
brother
of
course
chance
will
occasionally
see
to
it
that
you
do
find
a
appropriate
match
but
on
these
occasion
you
sabotage
the
relationship
it
be
connect
to
the
conflict
at
you
core
the
tension
between
a
conventional
life
and
yearning
to
heed
the
call
of
adventure
okay
I
do
not
yearn
to
head
the
call
of
adventure
the
only
thing
I
yearn
to
do
right
now
be
to
get
some
work
do
well
kitty
should
be
do
tidy
up
the
scene
of
she
stage
murder
very
soon
between
the
two
of
you
we
should
be
through
these
stack
in
no
time
where
be
you
go
this
mural
--
not
only
be
it
ugly
it
be
incongruous
and
I
shall
not
be
able
to
volunteer
effectively
until
I
know
how
it
come
to
be
hang
here
those
six
stand
out
you
may
cease
you
drudgery
that
mural
I
know
it
be
significant
the
moment
I
lay
eye
on
its
grotesque
majesty
I
call
the
director
of
the
program
and
I
ask
he
all
about
it
it
be
call
the
magical
myristica
tour
and
it
be
paint
by
one
of
spaulding
former

magical
myristica

tree

scene
cleaner

dozen
of
case
for

have
take
on
more
employee
maybe
even
franchise
what
do
you
do
you
retire
take
up
painting
be
this
interrogation
bother
you
WOODBINE
presumably
you
have
be
to
you
fair
share
of
crime
scene
you
know
how
difficult
it
be
to
see
what
we
see
the
blood
the
viscera
the
heartbreak
we
know
you
do
not
quit
the
clean-up
business
Woodbine
you
just
switch
side
you
start
work
for
the
criminal
instead
of
the
cop
and
you
help
disappear
all
of
these
people
the
bad
guy
pay
more
we
get
that
that
be
why
we
be
not
look
at
you
for
any
of
the
murder
for
now
but
you
give
we
the
name
of
the
individual
who
do
kill
these
people
we
will
recommend
a
deal
to
the
da
I
have
break
no
law
you
have
no
proof
of
any
wrongdoing
just
some
claim
that
some
potential
crime
scene
smell
like
nutmeg
my
mother
keep
nutmeg
in
she
spice
rack
maybe
you
want
to
question
she
too
well
so
much
for
get
he
to
cooperate
disappointing
but
not
surprising
fortunately
there
be
other
way
to
undo
he
Conrad
Woodbine
be
we
cleaner
of
that
we
have
no
doubt
problem
be
of
course
he
be
a
cleaner
he
be
base
on
leave
no
evidence
behind
right
but
you
say
that
there
be
another
way
to
get
he
I
submit
that
he
undoing
lie
not
in
the
physical
evidence
but
in
the
necessary
evil
of
every
business
in
the
service
industry
customer
he
would
not
give
they
up
but
they
might
give
he
up
we
figure
out
who
want
each
of
these
people
dead
and
then
we
offer
they
the
same
kind
of
deal
that
he
turn
down
well
the
only
person
we
know
have
a
connection
with
he
be
Raymond
Carpenter
in
point
of
fact
the
connection
lie
between
carpenter
hire
hand
and
woodbine
you
be
talk
about
the
man
who
kill
Jessica
holder
but
he
be
be
dead
for
year
well
lucky
for
we
though
unlucky
for
the
disappear
Woodbine
career
be
prolific
so
while
he
be
be
interrogate
this
afternoon
I
begin
at
where
I
believe
to
be
the
beginning
six
year
ago
Conrad
Woodbine
retire
from
cleaning
at
least
officially
at
the
same
time
a
group
of
armenian
criminal
arrive
in
New
York
they
look
to
establish
themselves
in
Howard
beach
much
to
the
chagrin
of
the
costa
rican
gang
that
already
reside
there
War
ensue
but
month
later
the
brain
trust
of
that
costa
rican
faction
just
disappear
you
think
the
Armenians
kill
they
and
Woodbine
clean
they
there
be
never
any
word
of
what
happen
only
rumor
they
would
be
slaughter
in
the
backroom
of
a
restaurant
they
frequent
a
detective
who
go
there
report
a
unusual
smell
like
something
from
a
bakery
now
artem
Dedekian
be
the
armenian
group
leader
at
the
time
I
think
he
be
worth
talk
to
do
not
you
be
we
investigation
bother
you
no
tomorrow
we
will
speak
with
Dedekian
you
will
continue
to
pour
over
the
case
of
the
disappear
in
case
he
be
not
in
a
helpful
mood
we
will
need
backup
let
I
know
when
you
have
a
time
and
a
place
for
the
meet
I
have
something
I
have
to
take
care
of
so
that
be
Dedekian
he
look
Hale
retirement
suit
he
Captain
Gregson
be
just
finish
something
up
and
then
uh
we
will
begin
I
be
not
a
terrorist
I
shut
Chris
down
last
night
and
I
be
prepare
a
welcome
home
dinner
for
Andrew
tomorrow
I
mean
maybe
I
do
hear
the
call
of
adventure
or
whatever
you
say
but
I
can
do
that
and
have
a
life
perhaps
you
do
realize
I
be
not
criticize
you
yesterday
you
compare
I
to
a
baboon
with
inflated
genitals
and
then
you
call
I
a
terrorist
I
be
use
vivid
imagery
to
illustrate
a
point
it
be
a
attempt
to
be
helpful
you
romantic
inclination
be
not
a
flaw
to
be
correct
they
be
a
trait
to
be
accept
I
know
you
Watson
I
know
you
will
never
be
happy
within
the
confines
of
a
traditional
relationship
and
I
say
what
I
say
because
it
pain
I
to
see
you
try
to
fit
into
one
simply
because
it
be
the
default
mode
of
polite
society
well
there
be
no
reason
to
feel
pain
because
I
be
happy
with
Andrew
or
would
you
be
happier
without
he
alternatively
with
he
as
a
occasional
sex
partner
and
confidant
or
with
he
when
he
be
in
the
state
and
free
to
pursue
other
interest
when
he
be
not
there
be
any
number
of
possible
arrangement
all
you
need
to
do
be
find
one
which
be
true
to
you
nature
it
really
be
quite
remarkable
to
I
all
this
time
we
have
spend
together
and
you
remain
a
far
more
interesting
person
than
you
give
yourself
credit
for
thank
you
for
come
in
Dedekian
I
understand
you
have
question
about
someone
name
Conrad
Woodbine
I
do
not
know
the
name
the
name
might
escape
you
but
the
work
must
have
leave
a
impression
it
be
six
year
ago
he
help
turn
a
few
costa
rican
gangster
into
soup
for
you
sorry
do
not
know
what
you
be
talk
about
you
be
quite
a
unique
case
in
the
criminal
underworld
be
not
you
a
one-time
kingpin
who
be
manage
to
extract
himself
entirely
from
he
past
and
lead
a
quieter
existence
you
be
just
one
of
Woodbine
client
there
be
other
many
other
and
we
have
set
to
work
identify
they
so
we
might
offer
a
deal
tell
we
how
you
find
Woodbine
and
what
he
do
for
you
and
I
be
gon
na
help
you
work
out
a
immunity
agreement
with
the
da
office
one
of
Woodbine
customer
be
gon
na
be
a
very
lucky
person
indeed
why
because
he
or
she
will
get
away
with
murder
perhaps
even
murder
why
because
we
desire
woodbine
above
all
other
why
because

in
turn
give
we
the
name
of

all
clear
do
you
smell
that
NUTMEG
he
keep
he
concoction
hide
and
seal
there
be
really
no
reason
that
the
aroma
should
overpower
the
room
unless
do
you
notice
how
Conrad
Woodbine
walk
with
a
limp
yesterday
yes
I
think

knee
surgery
recently

soon
we
cleaner

clean
what

for
the
rest
of
the

whoever
take

of
Woodbine
leave
the
place
spotless
seem
like
the
killer
just
as
good
at
clean
up
a
mess
as
Woodbine
be
it
do
not
make
any
sense
Woodbine
be
the
cleaner
this
be
he
livelihood
he
would
not
broadcast
he
method
he
would
make
himself
irrelevant
maybe
he
have
a
partner
let
hope
so
it
sure
look
like
Woodbine
go
and
whatever
he
know
about
all
those
murder
go
down
the
drain
with
he
kitty
maybe
that
man
artem
Dedekian
kill
Woodbine
he
could
have
change
he
mind
about
the
deal
that
you
offer
he
Watson
and
I
go
straight
from
interview
Dedekian
to
Conrad
Woodbine
studio
that
be
hardly
enough
time
for
he
to
arrange
a
murder
and
meticulous
cleanse
of
the
scene
why
be
I
do
this
disassemble
the
Crime
Board
I
do
not
understand
you
be
just
give
up
maybe
we
can
find
someone
else
who
hire
Woodbine
without
a
live
cleaner
we
have
no
leverage
to
make
a
deal
with
one
of
he
former
employer
and
I
be
not
give
up
I
be
retrench
a
clean
environment
stimulate
fresh
line
of
thought
it
be
Raymond
Carpenter
the
guy
who
tell
you
he
order
Jessica
holder
murder
that
be
the
day
he
be
convict
of
18
different
felony
friend
and
family
with
he
they
all
look
like
they
take
it
pretty
hard
so
so
we
have
see
he
before
that
be
the
superintendant
of
Conrad
Woodbine
building
what
be
he
do
at
Raymond
Carpenter
trial
scan
this
e-mail
it
to
Watson
tell
she
we
have
get
work
to
do
Jessica
holder
may
have
be
kill
by
one
of
you
pay
assassin
but
she
body
be
dispose
of
by
Conrad
Woodbine
if
you
say
so
you
Carpenter
have
three
son
now
you
two
oldest
offspring
they
have
take
after
you
and
already
begin
to
flourish
in
they
own
fledgling
criminal
venture
--
help
along
of
course
by
you
incarcerated
hand
but
you
youngest
son
though
Jeremy
he
be
a
different
story
flunk
out
of
several
school
fire
from
every
job
you
have
manage
to
land
for
he
with
all
due
respect
--
a
wastrel
now
what
be
a
father
to
do
with
a
boy
like
that
send
he
to
trade
school
of
course
I
do
not
know
what
the
hell
you
be
talk
about
you
apprentice
he
to
Conrad
Woodbine
it
be
a
convenient
arrangement
Jeremy
would
earn
a
livelihood
and
Woodbine
be
only
too
happy
I
be
sure
to
accommodate
one
of
he
most
value
client
Jeremy
even
serve
as
he
superintendant
while
the
two
of
they
wait
for
murder
victim
to
dissolve
of
course
when
we
go
to
see
Woodbine
at
he
studio
and
ask
he
question
Jeremy
tell
you
and
you
could
not
have
that
could
you
Woodbine
know
all
you
secret
you
family
secret
I
mean
God
know
what
would
happen
if
he
tell
the
police
everything
that
you
have
hire
he
to
do
so
you
have
woodbine
take
care
of
Jeremy
kill
he
and
then
clean
up
after
himself
it
must
be
say
he
do
a
rather
good
job
you
finally
find
he
work
he
be
take
to
I
suppose
congratulation
be
due
what
be
you
two
do
here
anyway
do
you
really
expect
I
to
admit
to
any
of
this
nonsense
we
be
do
it
be
true
thing
can
not
get
any
worse
for
you
but
for
Jeremy
he
must
know
some
very
damning
secret
about
some
very
dangerous
people
we
know
some
of
the
name
of
the
people
who
hire
Woodbine
we
will
get
more
how
do
you
think
they
will
react
when
they
find
out
that
you
son
be
he
apprentice
and
that
police
be
press
he
to
make
a
deal
if
you
care
for
you
son
call
he
if
he
issue
a
confession
and
agree
to
testify
against
the
people
who
hire
he
we
will
see
he
be
assign
to
the
safe
environs
of
a
white
collar
prison
if
not
he
be
about
to
make
some
very
potent
enemy

who
will

keep
a
eye
okay
among

event
spectator
probably
we

protect
we

all
day
all
night
and

want
to
get
a
very
simple

be
if

see
something
suspicious
to
report
it
immediately
we

several
year
these
be
current

then
here
where
the
change
come
in
we
last
storm
instead
of
hit
we
Wednesday
which
be
the
original
forecast
probably

so
it
will
be
a
good
period
of
time
between

here
be
what
I
be
talk
about
this
late
Sunday
storm
come
right
up
to
the
coastline
but
the
bulk
of
the
moisture
go
over
northern
baja
we
will
still
get
measurable
rain
it
will
be
the
least
direct
of
all
the
hit
here
be
the
second
one
or
on
Tuesday
all
the
way
through
the
early
morning
hour
on
Wednesday
that
seem
to
be
the
day
when
we
will
do
we
greatest
amount
of
rain
then
we
be
go
to
hold
off
until
Thursday
evening
for
the
third
one

be
sort
of

we
be
go

some
extent

Kirk
Douglas
no
but
I
do
have
two
week
off
for
Christmas
during
which
time
you
will
work
with
I
will
I
if
you
be
as
intelligent
as
you

and
as
greedy
as
you
reputation
it
be
a
adaptation
of
the
novel
ex
exodus
you
have
read
it
no
a
colossal
best-seller
very
nearly
a
perfect
piece
but
there
be
a
good
story
in
there
somewhere
I
have
no
idea
but
I
have
Paul
Newman
we
have
speak
the
right
price
so
you
be
do
it
well
I
think
it
be
the
only
way
to
get
hum
to
leave
come
on
he
think
he
be
the
cat
and
you
be
the
mouse
First
of
all
it
be
good
to
see
you
again
great
to
see
you
Tavis
we
be
talk
on
the
set
with
the
crew
before
you
come
out
about
how
honor
we
be
to
have
you
on
this
program
almost
13
season
for
we
when
we
first
get
start
year
ago
you
come
on
early
on
when
you
be
still
on
Malcolm
to
the
middle
right
it
be
amazing
we
be
all
talk
about
how
happy
for
you
that
you
career
have
go
to
the
moon
you
be
like
half
a
egot
now
it
be
a
testament
to
you
that
you
have
still
have
the
same
cohesive
crew
with
you
we
be
just
so
happy
how
have
you
process
this
--
I
do
not
want
to
say
meteoric
rise
because
you
know
I
say
all
the
time
people
see
you
story
they
do
not
know
the
back
story
there
be
no
such
thing
in
this
town
as
a
overnight
success
how
do
you
process
this
trajectory
you
have
be
on
I
think
I
be
first
of
all
overall
very
fortunate
I
think
I
be
even
more
fortunate
to
have
success
come
to
I
later
on
in
life
I
start
work
as
a
actor
full
time
when
I
be
25
year
old
never
do
anything
else
at
40
year
old
I
get
Malcolm
to
the
middle
so
there
be
a
long
stretch
of
be
a
work
actor
go
from
paycheck
to
paycheck
and
just
be
that
guy
you
know
try
to
do
different
thing
and
try
to
look
for
opportunity
to
break
out
and
it
happen
so
it
be
very
fortunate
for
I
but
I
tell
young
actor
this
be
not
a
occupation
where
you
say
you
give
it
some
arbitrary
number
I
be
go
to
give
it
two
year
and
if
it
do
not
happen
in
two
year
I
be
out
this
be
a
lifelong
journey
for
you
you
have
to
love
act
you
have
to
love
it
and
I
do
I
love
act
I
know
you
love
it
and
we
can
see
that
in
you
performance
but
from
25
to
40
be
there
moment
where
you
do
not
give
yourself
a
time
frame
where
you
rethink
whether
or
not
this
really
be
you
call
or
you
vocation
never
never
think
about
it
never
wow
not
a
ounce
you
know
in
we
parent
generation
there
be
a
term
you
know
you
have
to
tighten
you
belt
sure
and
that
mean
you
know
during
lean
year
you
lose
weight
and
you
would
have
to
tighten
the
belt
well
I
accept
that
that
there
would
be
lean
year
and
then
up
year
and
down
down
and
up
and
down
and
I
just
accept
that
that
would
be
the
case
so
I
save
my
money
and
make
it
stretch
over
the
year
that
be
leaner
than
other
but
never
doubt
my
interest
or
love
for
the
art
form
that
this
be
where
I
be
suppose
to
be
I
be
glad
you
say
the
art
form
because
you
be
find
success
now
in
every
field
of
theatrical
endeavor
I
mean
on
the
small
screen
on
the
stage
that
play
be
a
huge
hit
obviously
on
the
small
screen
on
the
stage
now
the
big
screen
you
have
cover
like
all
these
territory
now
the
opportunity
have
come
to
I
and
I
have
try
to
take
advantage
of
that
yeah
this
film
Trumbo
first
of
all
great
piece
of
work
thank
you
when
we
think
Hollywood
we
think
perhaps
eccentricity
we
think
fortune
we
think
favor
we
might
even
think
luck
we
do
not
think
oppression
when
we
think
Hollywood
that
be
a
good
point
and
this
film
really
be
about
oppression
what
do
oppression
in
Hollywood
really
look
like
it
look
like
any
other
country
or
society
where
civil
liberty
be
in
jeopardy
of
be
lose
when
free
speech
be
take
for
grant
when
freedom
of
assembly
or
freedom
to
practice
whatever
religion
you
choose
or
to
belong
to
any
political
affiliation
you
choose
be
deem
a
threat
and
that
be
what
happen
in
the
and
and
through
the
in
America
where
the
threat
of
communist
insurgent
carry
over
to
the
American
Communist
Party
which
be
really
a
party
that
be
base
out
of
a
political
arm
of
union
to
try
to
get
more
clout
that
you
know
the
ideology
of
that
be
to
try
to
have
more
say
for
the
work
man
and
that
be
where
Dalton
Trumbo
be
involve
and
how
he
try
to
make
a
mark
for
that
and
he
thought
be
well
maybe
this
be
a
good
idea
it
come
out
of
the
depression
he
join
in
1943
when
we
country
be
ally
with
a
communist
country
so
to
speak
you
know
I
think
he
even
doubt
whether
or
not
it
be
the
right
move
he
quit
the
Communist
Party
in
1948
because
it
just
be
not
--
it
be
not
what
he
think
it
would
be
and
it
be
probably
the
same
amount
of
b
in
that
party
as
there
be
any
established
party
at
the
time
so
same
amount
of
bureaucracy
and
trouble
but
the
price
he
pay
for
that
five-year
journey
be
what
oh
deep
he
be
bring
and
summon
by
House
on
American
activity
committee
and
in
1947
be
find
in
contempt
of
Congress
for
not
fully
cooperate
with
they
question
that
infamous
question
be
you
now
or
have
you
ever
be
a
member
of
the
Communist
Party
and
he
feel
the
question
itself
be
un-american
that
it
be
unconstitutional
to
demand
under
the
threat
of
imprisonment
to
reveal
that
it
be
none
of
they
business
and
they
answer
the
question
in
a
roundabout
way
in
they
own
way
and
it
be
not
accept
by
the
committee
so
the
Hollywood
ten
as
they
be
call
back
then
be
all
sentence
to
a
year
in
prison
in
five
different
location
two
guy
in
five
different
location
so
they
be
strip
of
they
physical
liberty
and
then
once
they
get
out
they
be
strip
of
they
creative
liberty
they
be
not
permit
to
pursue
they
own
career
path
to
support
they
family
to
feel
dignity
in
themselves
as
a
citizen
of
this
country
they
have
to
work
in
the
shadow
they
have
to
create
to
be
able
to
write
and
try
to
submit
to
make
some
money
to
support
they
family
it
be
a
desperate
time
family
break
up
suicide
divorce
of
course
and
just
a
terrible
time
for
instance
Lee
Grant
a
beautiful
actress
and
director
she
be
blacklist
from
the
age
of
24
to
36
year
old
the
prime
of
she
acting
career
especially
for
a
woman
and
the
reason
she
be
blacklist
be
be
she
be
never
a
member
of
the
Communist
Party
not
a
communist
but
she
have
a
friend
who
be
a
communist
actor
and
on
the
blacklist
when
he
pass
away
she
give
a
eulogy
at
he
funeral
and
mention
that
she
think
he
life
be
hasten
--
he
death
be
hasten
by
the
pressure
and
anxiety
that
he
experience
by
be
on
the
blacklist
and
for
that
reason
she
be
blacklist
so
there
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
guilt
by
association
that
be
extend
to
people
who
you
know
neighbor
who
live
next
door
to
you
you
know
and
so
there
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
fear
at
that
time
tell
I
about
dalton
Trumbo
character
what
be
we
go
to
learn
about
he
character
when
we
see
this
film
he
be
a
irascible
contrarian
idiosyncratic
he
be
a
brilliant
talent
a
wordsmith
raconteur
and
irritable
flamboyant
and
dramatic
he
always
smoke
with
a
cigarette
holder
you
know
he
have
a
flair
and
he
would
pontificate
you
know
he
love
that
dramatic
and
he
would
love
to
have
a
opportunity
to
sit
in
this
chair
and
tell
you
exactly
what
he
think
and
you
would
be
fascinate
so
he
be
all
about
the
entertainment
value
of
it
too
but
he
be
very
active
and
prolific
he
be
a
letter
writer
he
would
write
to
the
School
Board
to
complain
about
the
amount
of
homework
he
child
get
or
he
would
write
to
the
telephone
company
to
talk
about
they
rate
be
so
high
he
write
a
letter
to
he
contractor
once
that
be
build
something
for
he
he
think
they
be
overcharge
he
and
he
start
it
by
say
dear
burglar
so
he
be
also
very
funny
and
witty
and
in
those
day
when
you
be
go
through
that
dark
period
people
often
turn
to
humor
to
lighten
some
of
the
pressure
and
the
load
that
they
be
experience
what
do
he
call
upon
to
get
he
through
those
--
that
dark
period
for
some
of
we
it
be
we
faith
for
other
it
might
be
family
for
other
it
might
friend
for
other
it
might
be
I
do
not
know
what
do
Trumbo
call
upon
internally
to
get
he
through
that
period
he
be
a
workaholic
he
use
he
ability
to
craft
a
clever
turn
of
phrase
to
try
to
underline
the
blacklist
by
do
the
thing
they
say
he
could
not
do
by
write
and
by
sell
he
script
in
the
black
market
and
hopefully
that
undercurrent
would
erode
the
structure
and
collapse
upon
itself
he
do
not
want
this
fight
in
all
the
research
I
do
on
Bruce
Cook
write
a
biography
that
this
movie
be
base
on
Larry
Sepler
and
Larry
son
he
daughter
be
still
alive
and
they
help
I
tremendously
he
realize
he
be
a
guy
who
would
fight
but
he
would
not
necessarily
pick
a
fight
you
know
and
this
come
to
he
he
do
not
want
to
be
summon
he
do
not
want
to
go
and
have
to
make
this
declaration
he
think
it
be
un-american
but
he
be
also
not
one
to
back
down
from
a
fight
that
if
you
provoke
he
he
would
come
back
and
fight
and
basically
it
be
self-preservation
he
be
defend
himself
and
defend
he
right
to
earn
a
living
in
he
chosen
field
and
to
make
a
living
and
be
responsible
for
he
family
and
whatnot
as
you
have
already
point
out
and
obviously
moviegoer
will
see
this
in
the
film
after
he
prison
term
as
you
mention
he
get
back
to
write
again
but
he
have
to
sell
he
stuff
in
the
underground
but
he
do
sell
stuff
which
raise
the
question
be
he
just
that
gifted
a
rider
he
be
just
that
good
or
although
I
be
sure
quietly
to
sup
support
either
or
or
both
no
I
think
it
be
the
former
because
he
be
good
very
good
and
he
write
oscar-nominated
film
prior
to
that
he
write
very
--
he
be
a
pacifist
he
write
probably
the
quintessential
anti-war
novel
call
Johnny
get
he
gun
write
in
the
late
but
when
we
country
go
to
war
he
be
a
war
correspondent
he
write
for
star
and
stipe
and
he
follow
he
in
Okinawa
so
he
serve
in
the
best
way
that
he
could
and
the
best
use
of
he
ability
so
when
push
come
to
shove
he
be
ready
to
go
but
you
know
I
think
it
be
just
a
terrible
situation
that
he
try
to
make
the
best
of
and
thank
God
for
the
qking
brother
who
do
not
care
thank
God
for
Kirk
Douglas
who
have
the
courage
to
be
able
to
go
against
the
current
and
say
I
do
not
care
what
you
say
I
be
go
to
put
Dalton
Trumbo
name
on
my
movie
Spartacus
and
it
be
the
first
time
in
13
year
that
Dalton
Trumbo
see
he
real
name
on
screen
and
Otto
premenger
before
Kirk
Douglas
announce
it
do
Kirk
Douglas
pay
a
price
for
that
I
think
--
it
be
one
of
Kirk
proudest
moment
you
be
sure
it
be
yeah
and
he
deserve
that
respect
and
that
thanks
for
help
to
break
that
--
the
blacklist
because
everything
be
point
against
he
do
this
he
put
a
lot
of
he
own
money
into
this
he
risk
he
own
career
now
you
have
to
know
at
the
time
there
be
about
two-third
of
the
country
think
that
we
be
already
pretty
engage
in
World
War
III
that
the
screen
actor
guild
the
Writers
Guild
the
motion
picture
academy
all
turn
its
back
against
they
member
fear
permeate
the
whole
industry
as
well
as
the
country
and
it
be
not
just
the
film
industry
but
the
house
on
american
activity
committee
and
McCarthy
hearing
in
the
Senate
also
go
after
government
employee
every
university
be
scrutinize
heavily
and
they
go
after
that
blacklisting
those
people
it
be
a
brutal
brutal
time
which
really
do
not
prove
anything
be
there
fascist
and
be
there
hard
core
communist
that
want
to
--
I
believe
there
be
but
you
can
not
take
the
entire
amount
of
people
who
have
a
different
ideology
than
maybe
different
from
you
and
say
you
be
all
guilty
look
at
the
japanese
interment
we
be
scare
as
a
country
we
do
not
know
there
might
be
japanese
spy
so
let
take
the
entire
japanese-american
population
and
put
they
in
jail
basically
hopefully
we
have
learn
that
lesson
and
we
have
to
be
very
very
careful
two
thing
one
be
how
you
explain
the
--
which
be
how
do
you
explain
both
patriotism
and
yet
at
one
point
he
be
believe
in
communist
idea
how
do
those
two
exiexist
communism
I
think
work
best
in
a
kibbutz
and
rent
a
cabin
come
up
the
second
night
we
will
cook
and
clean
all
work
for
a
common
cause
like
that
construct
work
in
a
actual
government
I
doubt
it
I
think
it
be
too
wieldy
as
we
have
see
I
do
not
think
a
true
communist
country
can
exist
you
even
look
at
Stalin
be
not
a
comm
communist
I
be
a
dictator
he
be
a
tyrannical
dictator
he
do
not
list
by
--
so
the
term
get
bastardize
here
we
have
a
look
at
and
transfer
that
name
over
to
the
--
maybe
we
just
get
someone
in
there
who
say
let
all
contribute
and
let
all
share
it
be
a
ideology
the
point
be
not
to
be
afwrad
of
someone
ace
opinion
that
be
different
than
yours
and
you
can
argue
with
the
point
and
disagree
with
the
point
but
the
fact
remain
that
that
person
or
that
group
of
people
have
every
right
to
express
themselves
in
they
ideal
because
that
be
what
be
truly
american
that
be
what
it
be
and
the
First
Amendment
be
not
create
to
protect
popular
wisdom
it
be
to
protect
unpopular
wisdom
that
be
right
I
assume
--
and
I
be
go
out
on
a
limb
here
but
I
assume
that
someone
who
might
perform
on
stage
as
a
thespian
but
there
must
be
some
sort
of
takeaway
from
each
project
that
you
do
it
seem
to
I
that
even
break
bad
there
be
lesson
to
learn
from
the
character
yes
I
learn
how
to
cook
point
as
well
there
be
get
to
be
something
you
learn
so
I
guess
the
question
be
you
another
it
what
do
you
learn
about
fear
and
what
do
you
learn
about
courage
yeah
that
be
one
of
the
base
expression
and
emotion
that
do
come
out
of
that
we
be
steep
in
fear
and
it
take
courage
to
get
we
out
of
that
and
we
talk
about
Dalton
Trumbo
we
talk
about
the
king
brother
fear
be
a
amazingly
powerful
emotion
and
fearmongerer
be
I
think
some
of
the
most
shameful
people
in
the
world
because
they
play
off
the
fear
of
other
it
be
base
cowardly
cowardly
and
we
have
example
of
that
throughout
we
history
and
any
time
someone
use
fear
to
motivate
I
be
very
leery
of
and
it
be
a
very
very
powerful
but
abusive
way
to
lead
and
so
if
I
look
at
we
leader
on
any
ideology
I
look
for
that
and
be
very
wary
of
that
there
be
get
to
be
some
great
takeaway
about
courage
you
be
play
lbj
no
matter
what
one
think
of
he
politics
what
he
do
on
voting
rights
and
civil
rights
be
courageous
unbelievably
so
what
trumbo
do
be
courageous
as
a
human
being
what
do
you
take
away
from
courage
when
you
be
play
those
kind
of
character
about
courage
that
be
it
cost
you
it
cost
Martin
Trumbo
a
tremendous
amount
it
put
he
relationship
with
he
family
at
risk
because
he
need
to
have
the
courage
to
persevere
to
try
to
break
down
this
unfortunate
structure
of
the
blacklist
LBJ
Lyndon
Johnson
arguably
will
the
most
effective
policy
in
american
history
certainly
in
the
last
100
year
FDA
could
have
a
good
argument
for
that
for
100
year
after
the
emancipation
proclamation
nothing
change
and
as
LBJ
say
without
law
to
back
this
up
the
emancipation
proclamation
be
just
a
proclamation
so
to
go
where
he
go
in
1964
during
my
lifetime
that
this
be
go
on
and
he
have
the
courage
to
push
through
at
he
own
political
risk
and
he
risk
and
he
lose
I
mean
the
south
with
Dixiecrats
the
south
be
fully
democratic
for
100
year
in
1964
that
completely
change
so
politically
it
be
suicide
but
he
know
it
be
the
right
thing
he
have
a
experience
when
he
be
just
out
of
college
teaching
young
mexican-american
it
--
they
do
not
get
the
chance
to
eat
breakfast
but
he
say
he
love
these
little
boy
and
girl
because
they
be
so
eager
they
be
so
needy
and
want
to
learn
wide-eyed
please
teach
I
I
will
listen
I
will
do
anything
and
they
love
he
they
would
embrace
he
and
he
be
so
touch
by
this
experience
that
when
he
feel
prejudice
in
the
town
of
the
white
j
--
he
know
instinctually
it
be
wrong
on
all
level
and
I
think
without
that
experience
he
would
not
have
persevere
to
have
that
happen
but
it
take
team
work
he
could
not
have
do
it
wi
without
it
be
like
win
a
championship
game
a
good
inside
game
and
a
good
outside
game

a
revolution
you
all
like
this
the
new
and
the
old
MISS
universe

COLOMBIA
I
have
to
apologize
that
moment
get
everybody
so
hard
to
watch
it
be
fresh
that
moment
make
I
so
uncomfortable
because
last
time
someone
announce
the
wrong
winner
on
national
television
George
Bush
become
we
president
that
be
crazy
but
see
that
clip
package
right
there
I
wish
honestly
of
all
of
it
I
wish
Donald
Trump
would
build
a
wall
around
it
build
a
wall
why
be
cosby
surprising
anybody
he
be
lazy
of
course
he
be
go
to
be
lazy
in
bed
he
be
the
only
comedian
who
stand
up
--
or
during
he
stand-up
he
sit
down
he
will
not
even
stand
up
to
do
stand-up
that
be
a
good
point
what
about
that
Madonna
and
drake
moment
it
look
like
he
be
kiss
he
mom
the
only
reason
he
do
not
throw
she
off
be
he
do
not
want
to
break
she
hip
I
mean
when
he
kiss
Madonna
it
be
like
he
be
the
opposite
of
Star
Wars
he
go
boldly
where
every
man
have
go
before
he
do
not
kiss
Madonna
Madonna
kiss
he
I
will
not
stand
for
Madonna
bash
that
be
a
moment
with
drake
I
enjoy
it
I
think
he
enjoy
it
I
think
more
happen
a
tricky
question
for
gay
man
who
would
you
rather
kiss
Madonna
or
drake
well
Drake
what
else
happen
I
think
full
monty
wow
that
be
bold
I
think
it
be
great
how
about
raven
Simone
whatever
I
can
not
believe
she
say
she
be
not
a
african-american
she
be
a
american
she
edge
be
nappier
than
this
couch
I
just
love
that
she
be
the
most
well
adjust
of
the
cosby
show
she
might
have
alienate
the
remain
three
viewer
of
the
view
with
that
comment
racist
she
be
so
racist
I
feel
like
trump
should
ask
she
to
be
he
run
mate
right
and
she
be
embarrassing
to
black
people
exactly
she
make
Rachel
Dolezal
want
to
be
white

confusing

Carson
see
you
hopefully
finger
cross
next
year
in
Times
Square
welcome
to
the
program
on
this
new
year
eve
we
look
back
at
one
of
we
favorite
program
my
conversation
with
astrophysicist
Neil
DEGRASSE
Tyson
a
scientist
work
for
a
decade
to
get
this
result
they
realize
that
the
element
on
the
periodic
table
that
we
might
remember
from
chemistry
class
owe
they
origin
to
thermal
new
clear
fusion
in
the
core
of
star
fusion
light
element
under
ehigh
temperatus
come
together
to
make
heavy
element
if
they
only
stay
in
star
that
would
not
be
interesting
but
these
particular
star
also
happen
to
explode
and
scatter
this
enrichment
across
the
galaxy
and
this
enrichment
carbon
night
ro
again
oxygen
silicon
all
of
these
element
scatter
into
gas
cloud
that
then
collapse
and
form
next
generation
star
system
one
of
which
be
ours
so
the
very
ingredient
that
exry
life
be
traceable
to
star
they
give
they
life
billion
of
year
before
we
arrive
so
we
be
star
so
we
be
not
only
figuratively
but
quite
literally

the
most
powerful
nerd

a
new

back

welcome
thank

Charlie
we
go
way
back
my
first
time
be
in
the
we
do
a
show
in
1991
I
be
in
the
family
thank
you
uh-huh
so
congratulation
on
Star
Talk
on
television
yeah
jump
species
we
be
all
very
happy
about
that
we
be
pretty
sure
we
think
it
be
the
first
time
ever
there
be
a
science
talk
show
on
television
we
think
it
be
without
press
dense
we
do
not
do
it
for
that
purpose
but
just
turn
out
that
way
what
I
like
about
it
in
read
about
it
they
come
to
you
and
want
you
to
do
a
television
show
you
say
why
do
not
you
just
bring
the
little
camera
into
my
radio
show
and
that
will
be
just
fine
I
when
I
say
keep
it
simple
I
do
not
want
to
do
anything
more
but
there
be
some
budget
to
do
some
set
dress
and
part
of
that
be
we
film
in
the
hall
of
the
universe
of
the
American
Museum
of
National
Science
can
not
do
better
than
that
I
get
to
announce
that
from
the
hall
of
the
universe
who
know
where
this
be
from
the
room
of
dark
curtain
that
be
right
this
be
the
deep
hole
right
here
you
have
come
to
the
deep
hole
and
I
be
here
in
the
deep
hole
you
be
down
you
be
--
so
but
it
be
still
structure
the
same
and
we
have
a
comedian
I
have
a
guest
that
would
be
you
I
happen
to
think
the
universe
be
completely
hilarious
but
I
have
someone
who
think
that
way
professionally
and
the
--
there
be
a
main
guest
who
be
typically
humann
from
pop
culture
that
be
the
real
difference
here
from
what
you
might
otherwise
expect
from
a
science
talk
show
my
guest
be
many
of
the
same
guest
you
would
see
tuning
into
late
night
talk
show
circuit
but
I
be
ask
they
different
question
I
be
ask
they
about
they
nerdhood
ask
they
they
science
teacher
in
they
life
that
they
like
and
hatedd
find
out
how
science
a
technology
have
impact
they
livelihood
you
be
not
look
for
people
pop
culture
who
happen
to
like
science
just
simply
for
people
who
be
interesting
to
have
on
the
program
well
it
matter
that
you
have
hear
of
they
because
then
you
will
take
a
interest
in
they
from
the
beginning
and
then
you
learn
these
extra
thing
about
they
do
they
have
a
nerd
underbelly
that
would
not
reveal
itself
in
anybody
else
interview
how
do
we
define
a
nerd
underbelly
oh
it
be
--
if
they
want
to
break
into
a
fight
about
which
captain
they
prefer
in
Star
Trek
or
do
you
know
Hans
Solo
shoot
first
or
do
you
know
there
be
these
nerd
question
draw
from
the
nerdiver
from
the
geekiver
and
so
I
think
there
be
many
people
who
have
hide
interest
or
maybe
there
be
a
ember
that
just
need
to
be
fan
and
then
it
will
ignite
and
then
you
will
see
and
feel
and
hear
all
of
they
interest
that
they
express
about
scientist
be
it
the
fact
that
people
be
curious
about
thing
they
do
not
know
about
and
curious
about
the
future
we
be
once
--
every
one
of
we
to
a
person
be
deeply
curious
about
we
environment
as
child
scientist
tend
to
not
ever
lose
that
and
they
stay
curious
they
whole
life
I
think
other
people
get
it
d
so
I
be
in
search
of
that
soul
of
curiosity
that
I
think
continue
to
lurk
in
all
adult
so
what
happen
do
we
tamp
it
down
do
we
in
a
sense
what
happen
if
you
be
in
a
class
and
you
say
what
be
that
let
I
go
to
the
window
no
sit
down
it
be
not
time
do
you
lesson
and
listen
to
I
talk
rather
than
engage
exactly
and
we
school
system
tend
to
be
--
reward
people
who
obey
people
who
do
exactly
what
they
be
tell
people
who
hand
thing
in
on
time
those
be
the
honor
the
best
student
as
we
have
come
to
define
they
yet
the
student
who
be
distract
by
the
butterfly
could
be
the
next
great
naturalist
but
that
do
not
get
reward
in
school
because
you
should
be
study
for
this
curriculum
that
we
have
establish
for
you
so
I
think
we
should
do
it
all
but
do
not
suppress
yes
you
need
a
curriculum
yes
you
need
exam
but
if
you
see
nrlg
in
a
student
be
express
by
--
energy
in
a
institute
be
express
by
question
they
environment
that
should
be
nurture
rather
than
declare
it
w
out
of
line
be
that
you
as
a
kid
it
be
so
I
as
a
kid
I
think
teacher
--
I
have
energy
in
the
classroom
that
there
be
a
sixth
grade
teacher
who
notice
that
I
have
all
this
energy
social
energy
border
on
disruptive
and
I
have
a
interest
in
the
universe
all
my
book
report
be
on
what
the
moon
be
like
and
Mars
and
the
space
program
even
then
yeah
start
at
age
nine
but
it
do
not
really
gel
until
age
11
fifth
or
sixth
grade
and
then
the
teacher
note
for
I
that
the
Hayden
Planetarium
the
local
plan
Tair
Yum
in
New
York
have
class
on
the
universe
and
I
start
take
these
class
after
hour
that
can
get
you
tired
right
after
school
you
go
to
do
another
thing
and
that
kind
of
tamp
I
down
in
the
class
but
now
I
have
a
whole
new
universe
literal
and
figurative
universe
to
devote
my
energy
to
when
do
you
know
that
what
you
want
to
do
be
be
a
astrophysicist
at
age
nine
a
first
visit
to
the
Hayden
Planetarium
do
it
for
you
that
put
something
in
my
vein
I
do
not
know
to
this
day
i
still
think
it
be
the
universe
who
call
I
and
not
I
who
call
it
really
and
so
I
say
wow
this
be
--
and
of
course
grow
up
in
the
Bronx
there
be
not
many
star
visible
anywhere
in
New
York
especially
not
the
Bronx
at
the
time
and
so
the
sky
in
the
plan
Tair
Yum
be
magical
to
I
I
do
not
even
think
it
be
real
I
think
it
be
a
hoax
I
have
see
the
sky
from
the
Bronx
and
this
be
not
it
therefore
it
must
be
a
hoax
not
know
that
of
course
it
be
portray
the
real
sky
by
age
eleven
then
I
have
the
answer
that
I
have
the
answer
to
that
annoying
question
that
adult
ask
child
what
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up
and
you
answer
be
astrophysicist
and
that
kind
of
end
the
conversation
pretty
quickly
you
about
I
have
be
on
a
mission
ever
since
you
have
say
before
that
when
you
go
outside
you
always
look
up
oh
yeah
yeah
and
too
many
of
we
do
not
do
that
I
have
be
do
that
I
do
that
even
back
when
it
be
kind
of
dangerous
to
do
that
because
prepooper
scooper
law
you
have
to
really
look
down
every
five
seconds
so
I
would
risk
I
would
risk
the
incident
just
for
look
up
and
any
time
especially
at
night
but
also
in
the
daytime
I
will
look
up
to
know
what
the
moon
be
do
Moon
be
up
in
the
daytime
as
much
as
it
be
at
night
contrary
to
many
people
--
can
we
see
it
yeah
it
be
just
harder
to
see
it
the
sun
be
so
dominant
that
the
moon
do
not
call
attention
to
itself
as
well
in
the
daytime
as
it
do
at
night
but
look
for
the
moon
what
phase
be
it
at
night
I
check
for
what
planet
be
come
out
and
the
most
beautiful
time
of
night
you
know
photographically
speak
be
twilight
there
be
the
twilight
the
curtain
of
twilight
color
the
sun
just
set
the
moon
become
more
apparent
the
first
star
you
see
generally
be
not
star
they
be
planet
because
they
be
brighter
and
I
always
joke
with
people
if
you
ever
do
star
light
star
bright
make
a
wish
on
the
star
and
you
wish
do
not
come
true
because
you
have
be
wish
on
planet
you
be
off
course
from
the
beginning
so
right
now
in
the
season
Venus
be
quite
striking
over
in
the
western
sky
after
sunset
and
when
view
from
New
York
City
it
be
kind
of
over
New
Jersey
and
you
would
confuse
it
with
plane
come
in
and
out
of
Newark
Airport
so
if
you
western
horizon
be
near
a
airport
you
have
surely
see
Venus
and
think
it
be
a
airplane
that
be
how
bright
its
light
be
reflect
have
you
ever
want
to
write
a
science
fiction
novel
yes
however
I
do
not
have
talent
at
write
I
wish
I
do
would
you
have
a
story
I
have
get
a
story
it
be
ready
to
go
it
just
need
a
good
writer
I
have
get
a
good
story
and
I
could
advise
on
such
a
story
but
in
term
of
character
development
and
emotion
and
--
I
do
not
have
the
experience
writing
certainly
not
write
it
and
probably
also
not
--
but
you
would
know
a
story
that
would
be
compelling
I
have
one
in
mind
right
now
I
be
happy
to
tell
it
okay
tell
I
okay
so
the
world
be
at
war
okay
you
mean
the
world
that
we
know
be
at
war
the
world
that
we
know
be
at
war
and
in
some
very
disruptive
way
not
with
large
weapon
but
regional
battle
everywhere
and
people
be
choose
side
and
then
a
asteroid
be
discover
tell
we
what
be
a
asteroid
be
a
asteroid
craggy
chunk
of
rock
in
Var
YANT
size
there
be
countless
ten
of
thousand
of
they
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
they
and
they
orbit
between
Mars
and
Jeup
ter
most
of
they
some
of
they
have
wayward
orbit
that
cross
the
orbit
of
the
earth
some
like
in
thousand
of
they
you
do
the
math
you
learn
that
earth
and
these
asteroid
will
collide
with
one
another
guarantee
eventually
so
what
we
want
to
do
be
keep
track
of
all
the
earth-crossing
object
and
moniter
they
ideally
you
want
to
put
lojack
on
they
or
something
where
be
you
now
at
this
time
it
be
10
do
you
know
where
you
killer
asteroid
be
so
once
you
do
that
we
learn
that
there
be
a
asteroid
that
could
render
we
all
extinct
so
at
that
moment
anyone
who
see
other
human
as
they
enemy
then
come
together
and
see
they
asteroid
as
they
common
enemy
and
the
technology
bit
that
have
be
develop
all
around
these
country
in
the
world
there
be
a
bit
in
the
future
that
formerly
develop
country
be
now
technologically
able
and
they
have
be
develop
they
technology
to
fight
war
we
find
that
we
have
to
assemble
piece
of
all
of
these
technology
we
develop
a
common
front
against
the
asteroid
not
only
common
front
but
we
need
different
piece
of
technology
for
the
deflek
device
that
we
put
together
and
so
then
we
all
sing
Ku
Mba
wa
but
you
could
make
this
so
real
that
then
the
head
of
state
come
into
play
the
conflict
not
only
within
country
but
between
country
run
with
that
but
wait
a
minute
go
back
to
the
science
you
could
make
the
science
so
this
be
real
you
could
make
this
as
a
real
possibility
yeah
so
the
science
would
be
not
only
in
the
threat
of
the
asteroid
and
find
it
and
search
it
the
space
mission
to
deflect
it
the
tool
you
would
use
to
engage
that
deflek
if
something
do
not
exist
you
can
go
into
the
laboratory
you
can
see
the
pressure
to
invent
something
that
will
work
you
find
out
that
I
have
a
piece
of
it
but
now
I
have
to
go
to
my
enemy
that
enventd
some
other
piece
that
come
together
to
make
the
whole
thing
work
it
can
be
quite
dramatic
maybe
we
can
have
a
little
piece
of
the
asteroid
still
hit
earth
because
you
have
to
flood
a
city
or
something
otherwise
Hollywood
do
not
buy
it
I
remember
in
the
movie
armageddon
the
asteroid
manage
to
save
earth
but
piece
hit
earth
and
those
bit
have
good
aim
one
decap
tait
the
Chrysler
building
they
be
like
aim
for
major
human
monument
around
the
world
most
of
we
surface
be
ocean
they
will
probably
hit
the
ocean
and
you
can
still
get
to
destroy
a
city
with
a
tsunami
when
be
the
last
big
one
that
come
to
Earth
two
year
ago
in
Russia
two
year
ago
one
the
size
of
this
studio
travel
mile
a
hour
collide
with
Earth
atmosphere
above
a
town
in
the
euro
mountain
of
--
what
would
have
happen
if
it
hit
the
center
of
Manhattan
Island
well
so
that
--
that
happen
to
explode
about
20
mile
up
20
25
mile
up
and
that
be
high
enough
so
that
that
energy
get
deposit
into
the
atmosphere
and
die
lawsuit
before
it
reach
Earth
surface
but
even
sew
that
be
enough
of
a
shock
wave
to
slatter
essentially
every
window
in
the
city
while
people
be
look
out
they
window
to
bonder
what
the
light
be
that
they
have
just
see
light
travels
faster
than
sound
so
they
see
this
bright
light
the
light
of
the
explosion
they
look
out
the
window
the
shock
wave
come
lacerated
face
hand
and
skin
1600
people
be
injure
that
be
a
shot
across
we
bow
the
universe
tell
we
ask
we
how
be
you
space
program
come
so
if
that
happen
over
Manhattan
it
would
have
shatter
--
in
Manhattan
you
have
a
different
problem
when
you
shatter
window
because
then
the
window
fall
and
they
become
these
saiber
sharp
saiber
descend
to
the
street
possibly
hurt
or
kill
people
pedestrian
so
have
the
United
States
or
any
other
country
do
a
lot
because
they
learn
the
Lisson
--
lesson
that
happen
with
that
asteroid
two
year
ago
more
people
be
talk
about
it
but
that
asteroid
we
do
not
know
be
come
until
it
be
two
late
you
might
have
three
minute
of
evacuation
time
of
you
city
that
be
not
large
enough
to
catch
it
far
enough
away
plus
it
be
not
large
enough
to
render
anyone
extinct
if
we
catch
it
far
enough
away
we
shoot
it
down
no
that
be
the
macho
be
you
a
macho
man
shoot
blow
the
sucker
out
of
the
sky
I
think
there
be
a
movie
like
that
the
kinder
gentler
way
be
to
deflect
it
how
do
you
deflect
it
so
there
be
some
interesting
plan
that
be
out
there
they
be
all
on
paper
nothing
have
be
build
nothing
have
be
fund
to
make
this
happen
so
one
way
to
do
it
be
you
take
you
spaceship
let
I
borrow
you
outliner
if
that
be
the
asteroid
you
can
bring
you
spaceship
nearby
and
park
it
there
and
they
will
feel
one
another
and
they
will
want
to
draft
towards
one
another
because
of
they
mutual
graift
but
you
do
not
let
that
happen
you
fire
little
retro
rocket
to
preventd
that
and
the
act
of
do
so
slowly
tug
the
asteroid
out
of
harm
away
you
be
do
not
have
to
destroy
it
just
make
sure
on
its
route
it
do
not
hit
earth
any
more
and
it
be
there
to
hurt
you
another
day
but
if
you
get
good
at
this
it
be
just
like
shoot
pool
cue
you
just
knock
they
out
of
you
way
so
that
it
do
not
--
so
that
be
one
of
the
theory
that
be
one
way
to
do
it
and
you
can
moniter
you
progress
if
we
just
go
and
blot
thing
out
of
the
sky
here
in
America
we
be
really
good
at
blow
stuff
up
and
less
good
at
know
where
the
piece
will
go
when
you
be
do
so
it
be
very
messy
to
try
to
explode
the
asteroid
you
do
not
know
will
it
break
into
two
piece
now
you
have
to
evacuate
two
coast
it
be
a
challenge
by
the
way
this
work
on
paper
the
engineer
have
work
this
out
but
there
be
no
plan
in
place
there
be
no
international
collaboration
in
place
to
fund
this
suppose
it
be
head
for
the
indian
ocean
do
you
tell
all
the
indian
ocean
country
you
have
to
fend
for
yourself
if
we
have
the
most
advanced
if
we
have
the
most
advanced
space
program
at
the
time
so
then
should
we
pay
for
it
do
you
tax
everyone
as
part
of
they
gdp
the
way
the
membership
at
the
be
tax
and
do
you
hand
that
money
to
the
most
able
country
who
can
deflect
it
and
here
be
another
one
let
say
it
be
head
for
the
United
States
and
we
deflek
it
and
the
deflek
fail
and
now
it
be
go
to
hit
Europe
now
what
do
you
do
so
all
of
these
problem
we
could
put
this
in
the
movie
could
not
we
exactly
you
be
still
think
Hollywood
no
what
be
the
most
important
question
unanswered
for
you
that
be
a
great
question
and
I
have
a
unorthodox
answer
for
you
okay
for
I
the
greatest
question
--
and
it
will
sound
like
a
copout
but
it
be
not
I
really
feel
this
and
think
this
for
I
the
greatest
unanswered
question
be
those
question
we
do
not
even
yet
know
to
ask
because
they
only
manifest
upon
reach
some
next
frontier
of
ignorance
and
so
yeah
I
want
to
know
what
dark
matter
be
it
be
85
%
of
the
gravity
of
the
universe
we
have
no
idea
what
be
cause
it
we
should
not
even
--
we
do
not
even
have
the
right
to
call
it
dark
matter
because
that
imply
its
matter
we
be
work
on
it
we
have
top
people
work
on
this
with
top
equipment
I
get
that
but
at
this
moment
we
do
not
know
what
it
be
and
it
do
not
interact
what
be
the
most
likely
answer
I
do
not
--
I
have
a
preferred
answer
what
be
the
preferred
answer
that
be
my
preferred
answer
but
particle
physicist
want
to
say
it
be
particle
because
they
be
particle
physicist
Rose
the
hig
boson
be
very
poker
withful
particle
if
you
be
go
to
be
a
particle
that
be
the
one
you
want
to
be
you
grant
mass
to
other
particle
I
grant
thee
the
mass
that
you
will
measure
for
it
so
there
be
dark
energy
the
universe
be
accelerate
in
its
expansion
against
the
wish
of
graferrity
we
do
not
know
what
be
cause
that
we
do
not
know
how
you
go
from
organic
molecule
in
early
earth
to
animated
life
that
be
a
transition
that
be
on
the
frontier
say
that
again
how
do
you
go
from
lifeless
organic
molecule
which
be
chemistry
chemistry
organic
to
self-replicating
life
base
on
those
organic
molecule
we
be
not
there
yet
we
do
not
know
that
either
we
do
not
know
that
either
we
do
not
know
what
be
around
before
the
big
bang
these
be
great
question
be
we
work
on
this
we
have
top
people
work
on
it
and
I
will
put
you
on
my
speed
dial
if
you
want
to
know
the
latest
so
what
be
dark
matter
we
do
not
know
we
should
call
it
dark
gravity
be
really
that
be
one
of
the
big
question
yes
it
be
and
the
other
one
dark
energy
we
do
not
know
what
that
be
what
be
around
before
the
big
bang
how
do
life
get
here
from
nonlife
what
be
the
big
bang
the
beginning
of
the
universe
I
know
that
but
what
Du
H
if
you
turn
the
clock
back
what
you
will
notice
about
the
universe
be
that
it
be
smaller
and
hotter
for
every
day
you
turn
the
clock
back
smaller
and
hotter
so
you
run
the
clock
all
the
way
back
and
you
learn
that
the
entire
universe
be
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
and
at
extremely
high
temperature
in
the
trillion
trillion
be
the
highest
number
anyone
have
any
comfort
with
but
temperature
much
hotter
than
that
so
when
you
have
these
temperature
you
the
thing
be
unstable
and
it
explode
so
you
have
the
birth
of
we
universe
we
do
not
know
what
be
around
before
that
so
the
universe
birth
and
then
life
sustain
I
would
order
they
that
way
because
I
be
a
astrophysicist
I
care
about
the
dna
more
than
--
I
know
we
have
life
and
I
get
that
but
all
of
those
be
very
real
question
that
exist
with
we
today
and
answer
to
those
you
just
start
dish
out
the
Nobel
prizes
if
you
can
answer
those
but
I
want
to
know
--
you
be
on
the
stage
if
you
can
answer
those
I
want
to
know
what
question
we
be
not
even
intellectually
mature
enough
to
ask
yet
because
they
will
reveal
themselves
after
we
answer
these
question
we
just
put
on
the
table
but
have
a
new
question
reveal
it
self
in
the
last
15
year
oh
yeah
yeah
dark
energy
be
discover
in
1998
so
17
year
ago
but
it
be
still
a
big
mystery
who
discover
it
two
team
measure
supernova
those
explode
star
out
to
the
fartherrest
reach
of
the
galaxy
and
supernova
what
be
interesting
a
particular
species
of
supernova
be
like
a
standard
candle
like
a
yard
stick
in
mesh
turing
--
measure
time
and
distance
in
the
yeufort
they
be
potent
in
you
ability
to
measure
the
expansion
rate
of
the
universe
and
the
size
of
the
universe
and
two
team
one
in
California
and
one
in
--
on
both
coast
be
work
on
the
same
problem
and
arrive
at
the
same
answer
and
share
the
Nobel
Prize
for
that
just
recently
do
you
--
everybody
this
be
a
simple
question
I
assume
it
be
the
most
frequently
ask
question
be
we
alone
I
would
say
the
people
I
sit
next
to
in
a
airplane
that
be
what
they
want
to
know
once
they
learn
I
do
Astra
FIS
sises
they
kind
of
recognize
I
now
but
in
the
prerecognition
day
how
do
they
get
to
the
question
I
think
some
people
still
look
up
and
you
can
not
help
but
wonder
all
these
star
we
know
enough
to
know
that
they
be
star
just
like
the
sun
and
they
have
see
the
newspaper
headline
there
be
planet
orbit
the
star
and
if
there
be
planet
how
can
you
not
wonder
if
there
be
life
and
if
there
be
life
be
it
intelligent
if
it
be
intelligent
be
they
smarter
than
they
should
we
be
scare
of
they
what
be
you
best
guess
my
best
guess
be
that
the
universe
of
team
with
life
the
universe
and
we
galaxy
in
particular
we
galaxy
be
sort
of
proxy
for
other
galaxy
be
team
with
life
but
that
complex
life
might
be
much
rarer
why
be
that
well
I
if
you
--
I
have
--
here
be
the
argument
you
have
the
time
line
of
the
earth
earth
be
bear
and
this
be
today
that
be
four
and
a
half
billion
year
now
put
this
planet
out
there
and
some
planet
be
bear
yesterday
some
be
bear
at
the
beginning
of
the
universe
you
do
not
know
when
in
the
time
line
of
a
planet
you
be
go
to
land
there
so
here
be
earth
throw
a
dart
at
the
time
line
most
of
the
time
the
dark
hit
earth
there
be
only
single
cell
life
wow
and
so
if
we
be
randomly
come
upon
planet
and
earth
be
any
measure
of
thing
single
cell
like
a
amoeba
yeah
we
spend
three
and
a
half
billion
year
as
single
cell
life
on
earth
and
then
we
have
something
call
the
Cambrian
explosion
of
life
the
chemistry
of
the
atmosphere
change
the
atmosphere
like
rocket
fuel
for
complex
life
and
life
now
have
the
cart
blanche
to
become
complex
because
the
system
can
support
it
and
now
you
get
limb
and
detector
like
eye
and
sensor
and
it
be
a
stunning
development
in
the
fossil
record
of
life
on
earth
and
so
then
you
will
have
complex
life
now
ask
so
that
be
a
smaller
piece
of
the
total
time
line
now
you
ask
how
often
do
you
throw
the
dart
will
you
find
intelligent
life
well
that
be
the
last
that
be
this
little
bit
that
we
define
as
intelligent
and
so
if
earth
be
any
measure
of
anything
throw
darts
at
planet
that
we
might
land
on
who
be
to
say
that
we
be
go
to
land
right
at
that
moment
where
what
we
call
intelligence
have
arise
maybe
that
planet
have
condition
that
be
especially
ripe
for
complex
life
and
they
start
complex
life
early
if
they
do
then
they
would
have
billion
of
year
to
develop
intelligent
life
and
if
that
be
the
case
it
be
quite
clear
to
I
that
if
they
observe
we
land
here
and
look
around
it
would
be
clear
they
that
there
be
no
scien
of
Intel
genlt
life
on
Earth
--
intelligent
life
on
earth
you
mean
if
they
land
and
look
around
no
it
be
just
not
what
we
would
describe
intelligent
life
not
what
we
be
look
for
we
do
not
want
to
mate
with
these
people
they
may
be
people
but
they
be
not
intelligent
exactly
yup
yup
what
be
on
Mars
Rover
be
on
Mars
I
be
happy
to
report
a
working
--
the
curiosity
rover
be
the
size
of
a
suv
still
project
yeah
yeah
so
what
be
up
there
well
Mars
be
--
water
Mars
the
martial
surface
have
rampant
evidence
of
there
once
have
have
run
water
so
that
say
something
yes
what
I
mean
by
evidence
I
mean
really
awesome
evidence
like
there
be
river
bed
that
meet
dry
I
anderr
river
bed
the
thing
if
you
fly
over
the
Midwest
and
look
at
thing
that
flood
water
have
do
and
long
time
river
have
do
cut
into
the
landscape
the
Grand
Canyon
kind
of
thing
you
see
all
of
these
telltale
feature
on
Mars
when
do
we
see
they
any
time
we
take
a
photograph
of
its
surface
so
we
could
have
know
that
without
go
there
no
the
resolution
be
very
hard
to
pick
up
that
be
hard
you
want
to
get
close
and
then
you
can
see
ridge
and
valley
and
mountain
that
tell
you
water
be
there
or
a
liquid
we
be
pretty
sure
it
be
water
but
certainly
a
liquid
and
by
the
way
to
I
ander
a
river
mean
the
river
be
there
for
some
time
right
you
do
not
I
ander
overnight
okay
it
be
a
slow
thing
river
do
not
only
that
there
be
dry
lake
bed
where
you
see
salt
deposit
at
the
bottom
and
how
do
you
get
salt
deposit
you
get
that
from
stand
water
that
have
mineral
deposit
in
it
the
water
evaporate
concentrate
the
mineral
deposit
and
when
there
be
no
water
leave
you
get
a
salt
lake
fly
over
Utah
that
be
what
Salt
Lake
Sphi
be
sit
next
to
should
we
go
to
Mars
yeah
why
not
it
be
feesable
and
doable
yeah
the
only
challenge
people
say
oh
the
radiation
we
have
clever
engineer
gure
out
all
the
technological
problem
it
be
money
just
money
be
it
really
oh
yeah
it
be
only
ever
money
at
all
time
be
you
su
preemly
disappoint
that
we
do
not
do
more
in
space
the
curiosity
part
of
I
be
disappointed
but
the
politically
astute
side
of
I
fully
understand
why
that
be
the
case
we
go
to
the
moon
--
we
be
have
other
priority
no
we
have
always
have
other
priority
so
that
be
a
false
excuse
when
we
go
to
the
moon
we
have
plenty
of
other
priority
there
be
a
civil
rights
movement
there
be
the
hot
war
in
Southeast
Asia
the
cold
war
with
the
Soviet
Union
campus
unrest
so
pr
we
do
it
because
we
be
at
war
that
be
a
act
of
war
essentially
without
the
weapon
and
if
we
be
not
at
war
the
motivation
to
go
to
the
moon
we
tell
ourselves
we
go
to
the
moon
because
we
be
Americans
we
be
explorer
and
it
be
in
we
dna
okay
that
might
all
be
true
but
the
people
who
write
the
check
do
not
give
a
rat
--
about
any
of
this
the
lofty
speak
it
be
be
you
security
at
risk
we
will
spend
any
amount
of
money
to
protect
that
and
that
be
when
money
flow
like
river
and
we
go
to
the
moon
in
that
climate
in
that
climate
but
should
we
create
that
kind
of
urgency
again
for
something
like
go
to
the
moon
you
know
what
I
joke
about
no
I
say
let
I
go
visit
China
and
whisper
to
the
head
of
China
psst
can
you
leak
a
memo
that
say
you
want
to
put
military
basis
on
Mars
do
not
tell
anybody
then
that
memo
show
up
in
the
Pentagon
we
will
be
on
Mars
in
ten
month
I
be
sure
one
month
to
design
build
and
fund
a
space
craft
and
nine
month
to
get
there
we
will
have
astronaut
that
be
how
motivated
I
think
we
would
be
because
that
be
how
motivated
we
be
back
in
the
1960
now
I
do
not
want
to
go
to
Mars
for
military
reason
I
think
there
be
a
strong
economic
reason
one
can
make
for
it
it
be
a
little
more
subtle
and
I
think
it
take
slightly
longer
than
the
proverbial
elevator
ride
that
you
have
to
save
up
for
you
member
of
Congress
this
take
maybe
twice
as
long
as
a
elevator
ride
and
I
be
think
I
vote
for
my
representation
in
Congress
I
want
they
to
listen
to
I
for
longer
than
a
elevator
ride
so
it
be
simple
you
have
if
you
be
go
into
space
in
a
big
way
visit
asteroid
mine
asteroid
jawntd
to
the
moon
science
on
Mars
you
be
do
all
of
these
activity
there
might
be
military
activity
all
of
this
to
accomplish
this
will
require
advance
a
space
frontier
you
will
be
invent
innovate
patent
will
be
grant
and
you
will
have
these
discover
weekly
if
not
daily
in
you
newspaper
and
that
infuse
a
culture
of
inquirery
a
culture
of
exploration
a
culture
of
innovation
when
you
come
from
a
culture
of
innovation
stuff
get
solve
when
you
ent
counter
problem
you
whole
mindset
be
different
do
you
believe
we
lose
the
culture
of
innovation
yes
it
have
be
go
since
we
go
to
the
moon
what
about
Silicon
Valley
that
be
a
culture
of
innovation
yes
it
be
a
great
culture
of
innovation
I
be
misrepresent
in
some
headline
when
I
say
--
I
give
a
talk
and
at
the
end
of
the
talk
in
response
to
a
question
Intun
say
what
do
I
think
I
say
well
the
world
have
problem
that
be
bigger
than
can
be
solve
just
wait
four
you
next
app
we
have
problem
in
transportation
housing
poverty
disease
energy
climate
and
so
these
be
huge
problem
and
if
we
all
silt
down
and
play
with
we
app
they
be
not
go
to
get
solve
that
be
what
I
say
the
headline
be
Tyson
attack
entrepreneur
say
that
they
be
like
cavemen
so
what
do
you
mean
what
I
mean
be
to
bask
in
the
pleasure
of
you
next
app
will
hide
from
you
the
fact
that
there
be
larger
problem
that
need
to
be
solve
but
be
you
simply
say
--
attention
on
the
next
app
ought
to
be
something
that
could
influence
climate
change
and
not
something
that
could
get
you
a
car
faster
yeah
I
do
not
know
how
a
app
can
help
fix
the
climate
just
yet
I
mean
if
there
be
one
I
want
to
know
about
it
I
do
not
know
how
a
app
can
get
rid
of
poverty
in
term
of
conservation
some
thing
poverty
could
develop
a
economic
model
sure
sure
but
okay
but
a
app
do
not
build
bridge
and
tunnel
and
transportation
system
which
raise
the
question
of
all
these
people
like
Jeff
BEZOS
and
elan
musq
and
Sir
Richard
Branson
who
want
to
create
some
kind
of
vehicle
in
space
okay
do
not
laugh
at
I
no
I
be
with
you
somebody
have
get
to
do
that
whether
or
not
they
will
suk
side
you
want
somebody
there
think
that
way
and
they
affect
how
other
people
think
I
have
have
student
in
class
I
have
speak
to
say
one
day
i
want
to
work
for
space
they
be
not
say
I
want
to
work
on
Wall
Street
and
get
rich
they
be
the
smartest
kid
in
the
class
I
want
to
be
explorer
I
want
to
invent
a
new
car
a
new
transportation
system
I
want
to
invent
the
next
rocket
that
be
the
influence
that
I
be
tell
you
infuse
into
a
culture
when
you
go
into
space
in
a
big
way
the
space
set
the
carrot
and
everything
else
come
in
after
that
be
that
part
of
you
commission
I
do
not
have
a
mission
I
would
rather
just
stay
home
I
--
when
you
get
up
in
the
morning
when
I
get
up
in
the
morning
I
hope
the
phone
do
not
ring
why
be
you
go
to
work
play
with
my
kid
have
a
play
date
with
my
wife
that
be
all
I
want
to
do
and
then
I
go
to
my
lab
be
you
serious
but
what
happen
in
there
that
be
glib
what
happen
in
there
be
I
get
a
phone
call
because
something
flinch
in
the
universe
and
they
want
a
sound
bite
on
the
evening
news
or
a
documentarian
have
a
idea
that
they
want
to
explore
in
a
story
tell
and
I
get
a
phone
call
and
I
serve
those
interest
I
be
a
servant
of
the
public
appetite
for
the
universe
that
be
what
I
do
I
do
not
go
door
to
door
I
do
not
--
you
will
not
see
I
march
with
plaque
ards
I
will
never
tell
someone
who
to
vote
for
it
be
not
what
I
do
I
be
a
educator
so
when
they
come
to
you
to
Dos
could
Moss
2
whatever
we
--
cosm
whatever
we
call
it
yes
first
be
Carl
Sagan
a
mentor
of
yours
that
be
the
easy
way
out
for
people
to
mention
the
relationship
we
meet
a
few
time
but
my
first
time
meet
he
be
quite
influential
on
I
note
I
be
in
high
school
he
be
a
professor
at
colonel
a
television
star
yes
he
have
not
do
cosmos
but
he
be
already
multfully
guest
on
Johnny
Carson
tonight
show
and
publish
best
selling
book
so
I
already
know
he
be
famous
there
he
be
make
time
for
I
a
17
year
old
kid
he
be
show
I
he
lab
in
Cornell
try
to
attract
I
to
attend
there
for
college
I
be
a
senior
in
high
school
attend
the
Bronx
High
School
of
Science
at
the
time
he
reach
back
do
not
even
look
grab
a
book
and
sign
it
I
say
wow
that
be
really
cool
he
do
not
even
look
and
that
be
a
book
that
he
write
he
do
not
even
look
whatever
he
put
back
there
be
a
book
that
he
write
so
I
still
have
that
book
and
it
be
sign
to
future
astronomer
that
be
the
extent
of
it
I
meet
he
a
few
more
time
after
that
but
that
be
indelible
you
know
some
--
people
sometimes
think
that
big
thing
be
what
be
big
but
almost
I
think
more
often
in
life
there
be
little
thing
that
be
big
I
be
a
little
part
of
he
day
but
he
be
a
big
part
of
my
the
little
thing
be
big
roll
tape
here
it
be
there
be
two
kiendz
of
thing
one
be
what
I
just
talk
about
base
on
science
and
technology
in
which
nobody
understand
anything
about
science
and
technology
and
this
imussable
mixture
of
ignorance
and
power
sooner
or
later
be
go
to
blow
up
in
we
face
I
mean
who
be
run
the
science
and
technology
in
a
democracy
if
the
people
do
not
know
anything
about
it
and
the
second
reason
that
I
be
worried
about
this
be
that
science
be
more
than
a
body
of
knowledge
it
be
a
way
of
thinking
a
way
of
sceptically
intergailt
the
universe
with
a
fine
understanding
of
human
fall
ability
if
we
be
not
able
to
ask
sceptical
question
to
intergate
those
who
tell
we
that
something
be
true
to
be
sceptical
of
those
in
authority
then
we
be
up
for
grab
for
the
next
Charl
Tan
political
--
who
come
amable
along
it
be
a
thing
that
Jeferson
lay
great
stress
on
it
be
not
enough
he
say
to
enshrine
some
rights
in
a
constitution
or
bill
of
rights
the
people
have
to
be
educate
and
they
have
to
practice
thrair
scept
kism
and
they
education
otherwise
we
do
not
run
the
government
the
government
run
we
Charlie
be
that
the
same
table
same
glass
same
I
that
be
kind
of
spooky
see
he
he
be
as
alive
now
as
he
be
back
then
but
that
be
a
famous
interview
I
do
which
he
talk
about
die
yes
that
would
have
be
95
he
do
not
live
much
longer
than
that
that
be
1996
he
die
that
year
the
year
he
die
he
say
it
better
than
any
of
we
connect
science
literacy
with
what
it
be
to
have
a
inform
democracy
if
you
want
to
take
control
of
you
fate
you
can
not
do
it
if
you
be
misinform
or
underinform
about
what
actually
matter
and
in
this
the
21s
sentd
ree
it
be
go
to
matter
I
be
concerned
about
this
I
be
concerned
about
the
thing
you
talk
about
you
just
get
another
award
for
you
service
to
science
in
term
of
raise
the
necessity
of
pay
attention
to
science
and
popularize
science
and
make
we
understand
the
importance
of
train
new
scientist
public
welfare
--
from
the
National
Academy
so
I
worry
that
we
--
be
we
lose
not
we
sort
of
competitive
edge
but
be
we
lose
the
race
to
develop
the
vice
mind
in
sufficient
quantity
that
we
serve
science
as
well
as
other
people
may
come
to
serve
science
yeah
I
think
a
lot
of
focus
tend
to
be
on
who
the
brightest
student
can
we
get
they
interested
in
science
and
can
they
invent
something
to
save
the
world
I
think
that
we
will
always
be
the
smartest
kid
in
the
class
there
will
always
be
that
I
be
not
really
worried
about
they
I
be
worried
about
the
rest
of
everyone
else
who
be
give
the
freedom
to
say
to
themselves
and
to
other
I
be
never
good
at
math
Ha
ha
ha
Science
that
be
not
for
I
I
be
into
this
other
stuff
and
show
be
okay
with
that
suppose
I
say
to
any
other
person
you
know
I
do
not
read
cuz
I
be
never
good
at
noun
and
verb
I
stick
with
science
you
would
laugh
I
out
of
the
room
these
be
fundamental
part
of
civilization
the
art
and
the
sciences
have
define
civilization
ever
since
there
be
be
civilization
to
separate
yourself
from
one
or
the
other
and
claim
to
be
inform
as
the
good
doctor
Sagan
say
that
be
a
imussable
mixture
especially
if
that
kind
of
ignorance
be
in
--
be
wield
by
people
in
power
so
for
I
it
be
sufficient
to
say
let
we
spread
a
appreciation
of
science
to
everyone
they
do
not
have
to
be
scientist
but
understand
what
it
be
if
they
understand
it
they
be
more
likely
to
support
it
sure
but
it
be
not
support
it
like
it
be
a
thing
but
it
be
it
be
clear
what
you
be
support
you
be
support
the
idea
that
science
be
important
and
you
be
create
a
culture
that
respect
it
and
therefore
want
to
enhance
it
could
not
have
say
it
better
myself
so
if
the
people
understand
what
science
be
and
how
it
work
and
nvolve
scientific
and
thing
like
climate
change
and
issue
and
you
can
know
who
be
not
tell
the
truth
and
who
be
you
can
analyze
it
do
we
have
too
many
scientific
denier
in
we
country
or
do
we
give
too
much
prom
nen
to
those
who
want
to
look
the
other
way
in
science
there
be
some
of
those
and
dare
I
implicate
some
element
of
journalism
in
this
because
there
be
you
journalistic
ethos
not
to
tell
you
what
you
ethos
but
as
I
understand
it
and
as
it
have
be
tell
to
I
the
journalist
obligation
when
write
a
story
be
to
give
equal
colume
space
to
all
side
or
half
to
one
of
each
side
and
if
someone
say
the
earth
be
round
and
someone
say
the
earth
be
flat
at
some
point
you
be
go
to
make
a
judgement
the
earth
be
flat
people
be
flat
out
wrong
I
will
not
give
the
attention
you
be
waste
a
time
and
I
be
not
do
a
service
in
my
role
of
inform
the
public
and
so
I
think
journalist
be
really
smart
people
and
they
be
highly
educate
and
curious
they
have
the
curiosity
that
kid
have
that
they
still
have
as
adults
as
the
other
branch
of
curiosity
manifest
in
society
scientist
and
journalist
that
be
a
great
thing
to
have
but
at
some
point
invest
yr
brain
injury
to
recognize
when
something
be
fringe
and
report
it
that
way
and
so
when
you
do
that
people
then
be
properly
inform
about
what
be
and
be
not
true
what
be
a
emergent
truth
what
be
a
truth
that
be
in
doubt
what
be
a
truth
something
that
have
be
refute
be
responsible
on
that
frontier
and
I
think
that
will
help
that
will
help
my
job
certainly
I
be
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
this
but
you
be
a
journalist
you
be
a
journalist
you
do
not
have
to
apologize
I
be
not
apologize
I
host
a
talk
show
so
I
can
not
say
I
be
not
a
journalist
well
not
only
that
you
be
in
pursuit
of
question
yes
which
be
what
journalism
be
about
too
in
the
universe
--
I
think
you
might
have
a
dispar
aging
sense
of
journalism
so
therefore
as
I
be
characterize
you
as
a
journalist
you
might
be
offend
not
in
the
least
we
need
all
the
journalist
I
think
we
can
get
I
attend
for
my
very
first
time
the
White
House
correspondent
dinner
where
it
be
team
with
journalist
you
know
that
be
fun
and
lot
of
other
creature
it
be
a
zoo
for
sure
so
yeah
so
I
agree
that
I
be
a
journalist
as
be
scientist
who
ask
question
the
only
part
of
the
question
we
do
not
ask
be
the
who
the
who
what
when
where
why
we
be
good
at
the
who
what
when
where
why
how
but
the
who
the
who
move
the
black
hole
there
be
not
a
answer
to
that
who
do
we
know
what
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
black
local
no
if
you
take
einsteinsuat
do
a
primer
everybody
have
hear
this
and
have
no
idea
what
the
black
hole
be
sure
sure
it
be
a
region
of
space
where
matter
have
collapse
to
such
denszity
that
the
gravity
--
because
as
matter
collapse
and
get
denser
and
denser
the
surface
graferrity
get
higher
and
higher
if
you
be
stand
there
will
you
weigh
more
and
more
it
will
be
harder
to
escape
at
some
point
this
collection
of
--
this
blob
of
matter
have
condensed
so
significantly
that
for
you
to
escape
you
have
to
travel
faster
than
the
speed
of
light
and
so
which
mean
light
can
not
escape
if
light
can
not
escape
you
be
not
get
out
of
this
place
so
it
be
not
only
dark
it
be
a
hole
it
be
a
hole
in
every
direction
you
fall
in
a
three
dimensional
hole
a
black
hole
in
my
field
we
be
into
one
syllable
description
black
hole
how
long
have
we
know
about
the
black
hole
Einstein
could
have
predike
they
existence
with
he
own
he
kaition
--
equation
but
he
do
not
interestingly
enough
why
cuz
he
be
not
interested
in
they
no
no
to
scwoat
Stephen
hawk
because
I
ask
he
directly
over
dinner
you
knee
I
ask
why
do
not
Isaac
Newton
make
certain
discovery
with
he
own
mathematics
and
equation
that
he
invent
and
he
response
be
you
know
Einstein
do
not
come
up
with
black
hole
you
can
not
think
of
everything
he
simple
reply
that
be
--
what
else
do
you
talk
about
at
din
we
be
Stephen
hawk
the
conversation
be
slow
of
course
I
have
talk
to
he
as
well
and
you
have
to
submit
question
that
be
if
you
be
schedule
a
interview
this
be
just
banter
just
with
banter
how
do
he
do
it
I
be
go
to
tell
you
so
the
conversation
be
go
and
you
might
even
send
something
he
way
but
then
you
just
keep
you
own
conversation
with
other
and
then
later
on
that
answer
come
out
and
then
you
rejoin
the
conversation
where
he
kick
in
that
be
how
that
unfold
what
dazzle
you
about
he
the
sheer
triumph
of
he
life
or
the
quality
of
he
mind
I
would
say
all
of
the
above
and
I
be
delighted
that
the
public
get
a
glimpse
into
he
life
theory
of
everything
in
the
theory
of
everything
I
get
to
see
a
prescreening
of
it
and
it
be
clear
to
I
that
if
there
be
go
to
be
a
academy
award
for
best
actor
it
be
go
to
go
to
that
fellow
he
name
--
Eddie
red
main
yeah
it
be
clear
to
I
even
though
that
be
kind
of
a
indy
--
he
capture
he
he
become
Stephen
hawk
he
become
Stephen
hawk
and
at
that
point
the
actor
have
transcend
act
there
be
something
else
go
on
and
so
I
be
dlielt
that
the
public
get
a
glimpse
of
this
and
I
think
what
it
say
be
and
I
can
not
speak
for
disabled
people
cuz
I
have
never
be
disable
in
anyway
that
matter
in
this
world
but
when
you
see
someone
with
that
level
of
disability
meaningfully
contribute
to
the
world
and
be
hold
up
of
one
of
the
greatest
mind
there
ever
be
if
I
need
hope
that
be
a
plague
I
would
mine
that
for
hope
of
what
I
could
do
and
what
I
could
be
if
I
be
disabled
at
least
physically
dig
abled
the
mind
be
still
there
as
a
academic
I
value
what
you
can
do
with
you
mind
so
yeah
I
mean
it
be
--
if
anything
it
give
you
hope
for
what
we
species
be
capable
of
explain
to
I
time
travel
well
it
be
be
suggest
that
there
might
be
some
law
of
fis
you
can
we
have
yet
to
discover
that
will
prevent
you
from
go
backwards
in
time
Bawz
think
about
it
it
be
be
say
maybe
there
be
a
law
of
physics
we
have
yet
to
discover
that
will
declare
without
hesitation
that
thou
shall
not
go
backwards
in
time
because
if
you
do
and
you
prevent
you
parent
from
meet
one
another
unlike
the
term
naturer
series
where
you
have
to
kill
people
so
that
they
do
not
mate
all
you
have
to
do
be
prevent
they
from
meeting
or
prevent
they
from
have
sex
that
be
really
all
you
have
to
do
and
then
you
be
not
there
then
whoever
start
the
revolution
be
not
there
have
the
people
have
sex
ten
minute
later
than
they
otherwise
would
have
you
give
birth
to
a
different
person
than
who
would
have
lead
the
revolution
but
then
it
would
not
have
be
the
gorefest
that
it
turn
out
to
be
if
you
prevent
you
parent
who
would
have
meet
shall
go
meeting
each
other
you
never
would
have
be
bear
to
have
then
live
to
go
back
this
time
to
prevent
you
parent
from
meet
one
another
so
you
have
this
par
a
dok
it
be
a
causality
par
a
dok
--
paradox
and
that
be
say
we
have
no
shortage
of
interesting
way
to
go
forward
in
time
and
we
can
speed
you
up
send
you
on
a
spaceship
you
go
very
fast
you
time
tick
more
slowly
not
just
you
clock
and
then
the
electronics
in
you
Digital
Watch
I
see
you
have
but
you
physiology
everything
about
you
will
tick
more
slowly
you
will
age
more
slowly
than
you
twin
here
on
earth
you
come
back
you
will
be
younger
than
you
twin
so
you
have
effectively
go
into
the
future
that
be
one
way
to
do
it
you
can
also
do
it
by
--
in
graph
taitional
field
you
can
they
portray
this
in
the
film
interstellar
very
strong
graph
taitional
field
also
have
a
effect
on
what
late
you
time
tick
we
can
measure
this
the
gp
satellite
that
be
farther
away
from
Earth
center
than
we
be
they
time
tick
at
a
different
rate
than
ours
do
they
time
tick
more
--
they
time
--
clock
on
gp
satellite
tick
faster
than
clock
on
ert
but
they
send
you
the
correct
time
how
do
they
do
that
we
know
in
advance
about
Einstein
relativity
we
sneu
so
the
gp
satellite
be
precorrect
for
this
time
change
by
the
formlation
of
Einstein
general
theory
of
relativity
and
now
it
can
send
the
correct
time
down
to
we
otherwise
the
TIESMS
would
separate
from
one
another
and
you
could
not
use
gps
satellite
to
tell
you
anything
about
where
you
be
on
earth
surface
so
this
be
real
it
be
physics
it
work
it
be
not
something
that
we
cherry
pick
by
people
who
have
political
philosophy
that
differ
from
the
truth
exactly
and
tell
I
fienltly
about
this
thing
about
dust
you
know
remember
you
tell
I
on
the
60
minute
profile
about
dust
and
the
chemistry
of
by
the
way
not
everyone
come
out
of
60
minute
profile
better
than
when
they
go
in
one
never
know
about
those
but
thanks
for
you
interest
depend
whose
handle
be
you
in
thanks
for
you
interest
in
my
life
and
work
in
that
piece
dust
to
dust
it
be
a
exotion
of
the
earth
and
the
dust
and
what
be
within
the
human
body
oh
oh
okay
okay
I
just
need
to
understand
you
want
to
get
a
piece
of
that
I
do
I
be
try
to
leave
America
wh
a
real
sense
of
the
kind
of
basic
fundamental
thing
that
be
the
essence
of
science
and
you
work
and
other
I
think
the
single
greatest
gift
that
astrophysicist
--
that
astrophysics
have
bring
civilization
be
the
discovery
back
in
1957
by
four
author
no
movie
be
make
about
they
because
it
be
four
of
they
not
just
one
and
we
--
we
romant
advertise
the
lone
researcher
burn
the
midnight
oil
this
be
four
scientist
work
for
a
decade
to
get
this
result
they
realize
that
the
element
on
the
periodic
table
that
we
might
remember
from
chemistry
class
owe
they
origin
to
thermal
new
clear
fusion
in
the
core
of
star
fusion
light
element
under
high
temperature
come
together
to
make
heavy
element
if
they
only
stay
in
star
that
would
not
be
interesting
but
these
particular
star
also
happen
to
explode
and
scatter
this
enrichment
across
the
galaxy
and
this
enrimpment
carbon
Nie
ro
again
oxygen
sil
I
con
all
of
these
element
scatter
into
gas
cloud
that
then
collapse
and
form
next
generation
star
system
one
of
which
be
ours
so
the
very
ingredient
that
compromise
life
be
traceable
to
star
they
give
they
life
billion
of
year
before
we
arrive
so
we
be
star
so
we
be
not
only
figuratively
but
quite
literally
star
dust
well
I
like
that
finally
this
the
notion
of
you
you
do
not
have
a
mission
not
really
no
you
I
be
a
servant
like
I
say
that
be
how
I
think
of
myself
but
do
you
have
thing
you
want
to
accomplish
beyond
be
at
the
end
of
a
phone
where
somebody
have
to
ask
Ed
ability
to
whatever
they
project
be
by
give
they
a
direction
just
a
quick
bit
people
have
see
I
in
tv
in
so
many
way
and
shape
and
sigh
somebody
once
come
up
and
say
who
be
you
agent
that
get
you
on
tv
I
say
my
agent
must
be
the
universe
because
there
be
no
human
be
there
that
be
do
this
I
would
say
my
--
one
of
my
favorite
quote
I
do
not
remember
if
I
tell
this
to
you
in
the
60
minute
piece
one
of
my
favorite
quote
be
utter
by
Horas
Mann
the
educator
who
say
be
ashamed
to
die
until
you
have
score
some
victory
for
humanity
and
I
want
that
on
my
epitaph
I
want
to
be
bury
and
I
want
that
on
my
tombstone
be
ashamed
to
die
unless
until
score
some
victory
for
humanities
and
by
the
way
that
could
be
at
any
level
that
could
be
raisek
kid
that
be
responsible
you
know
that
be
a
very
broadly
define
victory
and
so
I
think
I
be
not
the
first
to
say
this
at
least
leave
the
world
a
little
better
off
for
you
have
live
in
it
just
why
not
just
it
be
like
clean
up
you
mess
and
as
you
have
clean
up
the
room
that
you
just
live
in
maybe
leave
a
flower
behind
something
about
people
can
come
in
and
say
a
better
place
this
be
a
slightly
better
place
and
then
we
could
all
celebrate
each
of
we
existence
in
this
world
and
not
lamentd
it
or
regret
it
or
there
be
so
much
in
the
world
that
regress
civilization
its
sad
I
wonder
how
far
we
would
be
be
it
not
for
such
force
that
operate
in
this
world
thank
you
for
come
thanks
for
have
I
pleasure
to
have
you
Neil
DEGRASSE
Tyson
for
the
hour
thank
you
for
join
we
you
see
you
next
time
Jean
rodenberry
really
deserve
and
should
be
up
there
because
Star
Trek
be
more
than
just
--
he
feel
the
television
certainly
it
need
to
entertain
but
it
also
need
to
inform
and
inspire
do
you
know
this
at
the
time
at
the
time
be
you
just
do
television
or
be
you
say
to
yourself
this
be
some
good
-lsb-

I
be

back
at

welcome
thank
you
Charlie
we
go
way
back
my
first
time
be
in
the
we
do
a
show
in
1991
I
be
in
the
family
thank
you
uh-huh
so
congratulation
on
Star
Talk
on
television
yeah
jump
species
we
be
all
very
happy
about
that
we
be
pretty
sure
we
think
it
be
the
first
time
ever
there
be
a
science
talk
show
on
television
we
think
it
be
without
press
dense
we
do
not
do
it
for
that
purpose
but
just
turn
out
that
way
what
I
like
about
it
in
read
about
it
they
come
to
you
and
want
you
to
do
a
television
show
you
say
why
do
not
you
just
bring
the
little
camera
into
my
radio
show
and
that
will
be
just
fine
I
when
I
say
keep
it
simple
I
do
not
want
to
do
anything
more
but
there
be
some
budget
to
do
some
set
dress
and
part
of
that
be
we
film
in
the
hall
of
the
universe
of
the
American
Museum
of
National
Science
can
not
do
better
than
that
I
get
to
announce
that
from
the
hall
of
the
universe
who
know
where
this
be
from
the
room
of
dark
curtain
that
be
right
this
be
the
deep
hole
right
here
you
have
come
to
the
deep
hole
and
I
be
here
in
the
deep
hole
you
be
down
you
be
--
so
but
it
be
still
structure
the
same
and
we
have
a
comedian
I
have
a
guest
that
would
be
you
I
happen
to
think
the
universe
be
completely
hilarious
but
I
have
someone
who
think
that
way
professionally
and
the
--
there
be
a
main
guest
who
be
typically
humann
from
pop
culture
that
be
the
real
difference
here
from
what
you
might
otherwise
expect
from
a
science
talk
show
my
guest
be
many
of
the
same
guest
you
would
see
tuning
into
late
night
talk
show
circuit
but
I
be
ask
they
different
question
I
be
ask
they
about
they
nerdhood
ask
they
they
science
teacher
in
they
life
that
they
like
and
hatedd
find
out
how
science
a
technology
have
impact
they
livelihood
you
be
not
look
for
people
pop
culture
who
happen
to
like
science
just
simply
for
people
who
be
interesting
to
have
on
the
program
well
it
matter
that
you
have
hear
of
they
because
then
you
will
take
a
interest
in
they
from
the
beginning
and
then
you
learn
these
extra
thing
about
they
do
they
have
a
nerd
underbelly
that
would
not
reveal
itself
in
anybody
else
interview
how
do
we
define
a
nerd
underbelly
oh
it
be
--
if
they
want
to
break
into
a
fight
about
which
captain
they
prefer
in
Star
Trek
or
do
you
know
Hans
Solo
shoot
first
or
do
you
know
there
be
these
nerd
question
draw
from
the
nerdiver
from
the
geekiver
and
so
I
think
there
be
many
people
who
have
hide
interest
or
maybe
there
be
a
ember
that
just
need
to
be
fan
and
then
it
will
ignite
and
then
you
will
see
and
feel
and
hear
all
of
they
interest
that
they
express
about
scientist
be
it
the
fact
that
people
be
curious
about
thing
they
do
not
know
about
and
curious
about
the
future
we
be
once
--
every
one
of
we
to
a
person
be
deeply
curious
about
we
environment
as
child
scientist
tend
to
not
ever
lose
that
and
they
stay
curious
they
whole
life
I
think
other
people
get
it
d
so
I
be
in
search
of
that
soul
of
curiosity
that
I
think
continue
to
lurk
in
all
adult
so
what
happen
do
we
tamp
it
down
do
we
in
a
sense
what
happen
if
you
be
in
a
class
and
you
say
what
be
that
let
I
go
to
the
window
no
sit
down
it
be
not
time
do
you
lesson
and
listen
to
I
talk
rather
than
engage
exactly
and
we
school
system
tend
to
be
--
reward
people
who
obey
people
who
do
exactly
what
they
be
tell
people
who
hand
thing
in
on
time
those
be
the
honor
the
best
student
as
we
have
come
to
define
they
yet
the
student
who
be
distract
by
the
butterfly
could
be
the
next
great
naturalist
but
that
do
not
get
reward
in
school
because
you
should
be
study
for
this
curriculum
that
we
have
establish
for
you
so
I
think
we
should
do
it
all
but
do
not
suppress
yes
you
need
a
curriculum
yes
you
need
exam
but
if
you
see
nrlg
in
a
student
be
express
by
--
energy
in
a
institute
be
express
by
question
they
environment
that
should
be
nurture
rather
than
declare
it
w
out
of
line
be
that
you
as
a
kid
it
be
so
I
as
a
kid
I
think
teacher
--
I
have
energy
in
the
classroom
that
there
be
a
sixth
grade
teacher
who
notice
that
I
have
all
this
energy
social
energy
border
on
disruptive
and
I
have
a
interest
in
the
universe
all
my
book
report
be
on
what
the
moon
be
like
and
Mars
and
the
space
program
even
then
yeah
start
at
age
nine
but
it
do
not
really
gel
until
age
11
fifth
or
sixth
grade
and
then
the
teacher
note
for
I
that
the
Hayden
Planetarium
the
local
plan
Tair
Yum
in
New
York
have
class
on
the
universe
and
I
start
take
these
class
after
hour
that
can
get
you
tired
right
after
school
you
go
to
do
another
thing
and
that
kind
of
tamp
I
down
in
the
class
but
now
I
have
a
whole
new
universe
literal
and
figurative
universe
to
devote
my
energy
to
when
do
you
know
that
what
you
want
to
do
be
be
a
astrophysicist
at
age
nine
a
first
visit
to
the
Hayden
Planetarium
do
it
for
you
that
put
something
in
my
vein
I
do
not
know
to
this
day
i
still
think
it
be
the
universe
who
call
I
and
not
I
who
call
it
really
and
so
I
say
wow
this
be
--
and
of
course
grow
up
in
the
Bronx
there
be
not
many
star
visible
anywhere
in
New
York
especially
not
the
Bronx
at
the
time
and
so
the
sky
in
the
plan
Tair
Yum
be
magical
to
I
I
do
not
even
think
it
be
real
I
think
it
be
a
hoax
I
have
see
the
sky
from
the
Bronx
and
this
be
not
it
therefore
it
must
be
a
hoax
not
know
that
of
course
it
be
portray
the
real
sky
by
age
eleven
then
I
have
the
answer
that
I
have
the
answer
to
that
annoying
question
that
adult
ask
child
what
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up
and
you
answer
be
astrophysicist
and
that
kind
of
end
the
conversation
pretty
quickly
you
about
I
have
be
on
a
mission
ever
since
you
have
say
before
that
when
you
go
outside
you
always
look
up
oh
yeah
yeah
and
too
many
of
we
do
not
do
that
I
have
be
do
that
I
do
that
even
back
when
it
be
kind
of
dangerous
to
do
that
because
prepooper
scooper
law
you
have
to
really
look
down
every
five
seconds
so
I
would
risk
I
would
risk
the
incident
just
for
look
up
and
any
time
especially
at
night
but
also
in
the
daytime
I
will
look
up
to
know
what
the
moon
be
do
Moon
be
up
in
the
daytime
as
much
as
it
be
at
night
contrary
to
many
people
--
can
we
see
it
yeah
it
be
just
harder
to
see
it
the
sun
be
so
dominant
that
the
moon
do
not
call
attention
to
itself
as
well
in
the
daytime
as
it
do
at
night
but
look
for
the
moon
what
phase
be
it
at
night
I
check
for
what
planet
be
come
out
and
the
most
beautiful
time
of
night
you
know
photographically
speak
be
twilight
there
be
the
twilight
the
curtain
of
twilight
color
the
sun
just
set
the
moon
become
more
apparent
the
first
star
you
see
generally
be
not
star
they
be
planet
because
they
be
brighter
and
I
always
joke
with
people
if
you
ever
do
star
light
star
bright
make
a
wish
on
the
star
and
you
wish
do
not
come
true
because
you
have
be
wish
on
planet
you
be
off
course
from
the
beginning
so
right
now
in
the
season
Venus
be
quite
striking
over
in
the
western
sky
after
sunset
and
when
view
from
New
York
City
it
be
kind
of
over
New
Jersey
and
you
would
confuse
it
with
plane
come
in
and
out
of
Newark
Airport
so
if
you
western
horizon
be
near
a
airport
you
have
surely
see
Venus
and
think
it
be
a
airplane
that
be
how
bright
its
light
be
reflect
have
you
ever
want
to
write
a
science
fiction
novel
yes
however
I
do
not
have
talent
at
write
I
wish
I
do
would
you
have
a
story
I
have
get
a
story
it
be
ready
to
go
it
just
need
a
good
writer
I
have
get
a
good
story
and
I
could
advise
on
such
a
story
but
in
term
of
character
development
and
emotion
and
--
I
do
not
have
the
experience
writing
certainly
not
write
it
and
probably
also
not
--
but
you
would
know
a
story
that
would
be
compelling
I
have
one
in
mind
right
now
I
be
happy
to
tell
it
okay
tell
I
okay
so
the
world
be
at
war
okay
you
mean
the
world
that
we
know
be
at
war
the
world
that
we
know
be
at
war
and
in
some
very
disruptive
way
not
with
large
weapon
but
regional
battle
everywhere
and
people
be
choose
side
and
then
a
asteroid
be
discover
tell
we
what
be
a
asteroid
be
a
asteroid
craggy
chunk
of
rock
in
Var
YANT
size
there
be
countless
ten
of
thousand
of
they
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
they
and
they
orbit
between
Mars
and
Jeup
ter
most
of
they
some
of
they
have
wayward
orbit
that
cross
the
orbit
of
the
earth
some
like
in
thousand
of
they
you
do
the
math
you
learn
that
earth
and
these
asteroid
will
collide
with
one
another
guarantee
eventually
so
what
we
want
to
do
be
keep
track
of
all
the
earth-crossing
object
and
moniter
they
ideally
you
want
to
put
lojack
on
they
or
something
where
be
you
now
at
this
time
it
be
10
do
you
know
where
you
killer
asteroid
be
so
once
you
do
that
we
learn
that
there
be
a
asteroid
that
could
render
we
all
extinct
so
at
that
moment
anyone
who
see
other
human
as
they
enemy
then
come
together
and
see
they
asteroid
as
they
common
enemy
and
the
technology
bit
that
have
be
develop
all
around
these
country
in
the
world
there
be
a
bit
in
the
future
that
formerly
develop
country
be
now
technologically
able
and
they
have
be
develop
they
technology
to
fight
war
we
find
that
we
have
to
assemble
piece
of
all
of
these
technology
we
develop
a
common
front
against
the
asteroid
not
only
common
front
but
we
need
different
piece
of
technology
for
the
deflek
device
that
we
put
together
and
so
then
we
all
sing
Ku
Mba
wa
but
you
could
make
this
so
real
that
then
the
head
of
state
come
into
play
the
conflict
not
only
within
country
but
between
country
run
with
that
but
wait
a
minute
go
back
to
the
science
you
could
make
the
science
so
this
be
real
you
could
make
this
as
a
real
possibility
yeah
so
the
science
would
be
not
only
in
the
threat
of
the
asteroid
and
find
it
and
search
it
the
space
mission
to
deflect
it
the
tool
you
would
use
to
engage
that
deflek
if
something
do
not
exist
you
can
go
into
the
laboratory
you
can
see
the
pressure
to
invent
something
that
will
work
you
find
out
that
I
have
a
piece
of
it
but
now
I
have
to
go
to
my
enemy
that
enventd
some
other
piece
that
come
together
to
make
the
whole
thing
work
it
can
be
quite
dramatic
maybe
we
can
have
a
little
piece
of
the
asteroid
still
hit
earth
because
you
have
to
flood
a
city
or
something
otherwise
Hollywood
do
not
buy
it
I
remember
in
the
movie
armageddon
the
asteroid
manage
to
save
earth
but
piece
hit
earth
and
those
bit
have
good
aim
one
decap
tait
the
Chrysler
building
they
be
like
aim
for
major
human
monument
around
the
world
most
of
we
surface
be
ocean
they
will
probably
hit
the
ocean
and
you
can
still
get
to
destroy
a
city
with
a
tsunami
when
be
the
last
big
one
that
come
to
Earth
two
year
ago
in
Russia
two
year
ago
one
the
size
of
this
studio
travel
mile
a
hour
collide
with
Earth
atmosphere
above
a
town
in
the
euro
mountain
of
--
what
would
have
happen
if
it
hit
the
center
of
Manhattan
Island
well
so
that
--
that
happen
to
explode
about
20
mile
up
20
25
mile
up
and
that
be
high
enough
so
that
that
energy
get
deposit
into
the
atmosphere
and
die
lawsuit
before
it
reach
Earth
surface
but
even
sew
that
be
enough
of
a
shock
wave
to
slatter
essentially
every
window
in
the
city
while
people
be
look
out
they
window
to
bonder
what
the
light
be
that
they
have
just
see
light
travels
faster
than
sound
so
they
see
this
bright
light
the
light
of
the
explosion
they
look
out
the
window
the
shock
wave
come
lacerated
face
hand
and
skin
1600
people
be
injure
that
be
a
shot
across
we
bow
the
universe
tell
we
ask
we
how
be
you
space
program
come
so
if
that
happen
over
Manhattan
it
would
have
shatter
--
in
Manhattan
you
have
a
different
problem
when
you
shatter
window
because
then
the
window
fall
and
they
become
these
saiber
sharp
saiber
descend
to
the
street
possibly
hurt
or
kill
people
pedestrian
so
have
the
United
States
or
any
other
country
do
a
lot
because
they
learn
the
Lisson
--
lesson
that
happen
with
that
asteroid
two
year
ago
more
people
be
talk
about
it
but
that
asteroid
we
do
not
know
be
come
until
it
be
two
late
you
might
have
three
minute
of
evacuation
time
of
you
city
that
be
not
large
enough
to
catch
it
far
enough
away
plus
it
be
not
large
enough
to
render
anyone
extinct
if
we
catch
it
far
enough
away
we
shoot
it
down
no
that
be
the
macho
be
you
a
macho
man
shoot
blow
the
sucker
out
of
the
sky
I
think
there
be
a
movie
like
that
the
kinder
gentler
way
be
to
deflect
it
how
do
you
deflect
it
so
there
be
some
interesting
plan
that
be
out
there
they
be
all
on
paper
nothing
have
be
build
nothing
have
be
fund
to
make
this
happen
so
one
way
to
do
it
be
you
take
you
spaceship
let
I
borrow
you
outliner
if
that
be
the
asteroid
you
can
bring
you
spaceship
nearby
and
park
it
there
and
they
will
feel
one
another
and
they
will
want
to
draft
towards
one
another
because
of
they
mutual
graift
but
you
do
not
let
that
happen
you
fire
little
retro
rocket
to
preventd
that
and
the
act
of
do
so
slowly
tug
the
asteroid
out
of
harm
away
you
be
do
not
have
to
destroy
it
just
make
sure
on
its
route
it
do
not
hit
earth
any
more
and
it
be
there
to
hurt
you
another
day
but
if
you
get
good
at
this
it
be
just
like
shoot
pool
cue
you
just
knock
they
out
of
you
way
so
that
it
do
not
--
so
that
be
one
of
the
theory
that
be
one
way
to
do
it
and
you
can
moniter
you
progress
if
we
just
go
and
blot
thing
out
of
the
sky
here
in
America
we
be
really
good
at
blow
stuff
up
and
less
good
at
know
where
the
piece
will
go
when
you
be
do
so
it
be
very
messy
to
try
to
explode
the
asteroid
you
do
not
know
will
it
break
into
two
piece
now
you
have
to
evacuate
two
coast
it
be
a
challenge
by
the
way
this
work
on
paper
the
engineer
have
work
this
out
but
there
be
no
plan
in
place
there
be
no
international
collaboration
in
place
to
fund
this
suppose
it
be
head
for
the
indian
ocean
do
you
tell
all
the
indian
ocean
country
you
have
to
fend
for
yourself
if
we
have
the
most
advanced
if
we
have
the
most
advanced
space
program
at
the
time
so
then
should
we
pay
for
it
do
you
tax
everyone
as
part
of
they
gdp
the
way
the
membership
at
the
be
tax
and
do
you
hand
that
money
to
the
most
able
country
who
can
deflect
it
and
here
be
another
one
let
say
it
be
head
for
the
United
States
and
we
deflek
it
and
the
deflek
fail
and
now
it
be
go
to
hit
Europe
now
what
do
you
do
so
all
of
these
problem
we
could
put
this
in
the
movie
could
not
we
exactly
you
be
still
think
Hollywood
no
what
be
the
most
important
question
unanswered
for
you
that
be
a
great
question
and
I
have
a
unorthodox
answer
for
you
okay
for
I
the
greatest
question
--
and
it
will
sound
like
a
copout
but
it
be
not
I
really
feel
this
and
think
this
for
I
the
greatest
unanswered
question
be
those
question
we
do
not
even
yet
know
to
ask
because
they
only
manifest
upon
reach
some
next
frontier
of
ignorance
and
so
yeah
I
want
to
know
what
dark
matter
be
it
be
85
%
of
the
gravity
of
the
universe
we
have
no
idea
what
be
cause
it
we
should
not
even
--
we
do
not
even
have
the
right
to
call
it
dark
matter
because
that
imply
its
matter
we
be
work
on
it
we
have
top
people
work
on
this
with
top
equipment
I
get
that
but
at
this
moment
we
do
not
know
what
it
be
and
it
do
not
interact
what
be
the
most
likely
answer
I
do
not
--
I
have
a
preferred
answer
what
be
the
preferred
answer
that
be
my
preferred
answer
but
particle
physicist
want
to
say
it
be
particle
because
they
be
particle
physicist
Rose
the
hig
boson
be
very
poker
withful
particle
if
you
be
go
to
be
a
particle
that
be
the
one
you
want
to
be
you
grant
mass
to
other
particle
I
grant
thee
the
mass
that
you
will
measure
for
it
so
there
be
dark
energy
the
universe
be
accelerate
in
its
expansion
against
the
wish
of
graferrity
we
do
not
know
what
be
cause
that
we
do
not
know
how
you
go
from
organic
molecule
in
early
earth
to
animated
life
that
be
a
transition
that
be
on
the
frontier
say
that
again
how
do
you
go
from
lifeless
organic
molecule
which
be
chemistry
chemistry
organic
to
self-replicating
life
base
on
those
organic
molecule
we
be
not
there
yet
we
do
not
know
that
either
we
do
not
know
that
either
we
do
not
know
what
be
around
before
the
big
bang
these
be
great
question
be
we
work
on
this
we
have
top
people
work
on
it
and
I
will
put
you
on
my
speed
dial
if
you
want
to
know
the
latest
so
what
be
dark
matter
we
do
not
know
we
should
call
it
dark
gravity
be
really
that
be
one
of
the
big
question
yes
it
be
and
the
other
one
dark
energy
we
do
not
know
what
that
be
what
be
around
before
the
big
bang
how
do
life
get
here
from
nonlife
what
be
the
big
bang
the
beginning
of
the
universe
I
know
that
but
what
Du
H
if
you
turn
the
clock
back
what
you
will
notice
about
the
universe
be
that
it
be
smaller
and
hotter
for
every
day
you
turn
the
clock
back
smaller
and
hotter
so
you
run
the
clock
all
the
way
back
and
you
learn
that
the
entire
universe
be
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
and
at
extremely
high
temperature
in
the
trillion
trillion
be
the
highest
number
anyone
have
any
comfort
with
but
temperature
much
hotter
than
that
so
when
you
have
these
temperature
you
the
thing
be
unstable
and
it
explode
so
you
have
the
birth
of
we
universe
we
do
not
know
what
be
around
before
that
so
the
universe
birth
and
then
life
sustain
I
would
order
they
that
way
because
I
be
a
astrophysicist
I
care
about
the
dna
more
than
--
I
know
we
have
life
and
I
get
that
but
all
of
those
be
very
real
question
that
exist
with
we
today
and
answer
to
those
you
just
start
dish
out
the
Nobel
prizes
if
you
can
answer
those
but
I
want
to
know
--
you
be
on
the
stage
if
you
can
answer
those
I
want
to
know
what
question
we
be
not
even
intellectually
mature
enough
to
ask
yet
because
they
will
reveal
themselves
after
we
answer
these
question
we
just
put
on
the
table
but
have
a
new
question
reveal
it
self
in
the
last
15
year
oh
yeah
yeah
dark
energy
be
discover
in
1998
so
17
year
ago
but
it
be
still
a
big
mystery
who
discover
it
two
team
measure
supernova
those
explode
star
out
to
the
fartherrest
reach
of
the
galaxy
and
supernova
what
be
interesting
a
particular
species
of
supernova
be
like
a
standard
candle
like
a
yard
stick
in
mesh
turing
--
measure
time
and
distance
in
the
yeufort
they
be
potent
in
you
ability
to
measure
the
expansion
rate
of
the
universe
and
the
size
of
the
universe
and
two
team
one
in
California
and
one
in
--
on
both
coast
be
work
on
the
same
problem
and
arrive
at
the
same
answer
and
share
the
Nobel
Prize
for
that
just
recently
do
you
--
everybody
this
be
a
simple
question
I
assume
it
be
the
most
frequently
ask
question
be
we
alone
I
would
say
the
people
I
sit
next
to
in
a
airplane
that
be
what
they
want
to
know
once
they
learn
I
do
Astra
FIS
sises
they
kind
of
recognize
I
now
but
in
the
prerecognition
day
how
do
they
get
to
the
question
I
think
some
people
still
look
up
and
you
can
not
help
but
wonder
all
these
star
we
know
enough
to
know
that
they
be
star
just
like
the
sun
and
they
have
see
the
newspaper
headline
there
be
planet
orbit
the
star
and
if
there
be
planet
how
can
you
not
wonder
if
there
be
life
and
if
there
be
life
be
it
intelligent
if
it
be
intelligent
be
they
smarter
than
they
should
we
be
scare
of
they
what
be
you
best
guess
my
best
guess
be
that
the
universe
of
team
with
life
the
universe
and
we
galaxy
in
particular
we
galaxy
be
sort
of
proxy
for
other
galaxy
be
team
with
life
but
that
complex
life
might
be
much
rarer
why
be
that
well
I
if
you
--
I
have
--
here
be
the
argument
you
have
the
time
line
of
the
earth
earth
be
bear
and
this
be
today
that
be
four
and
a
half
billion
year
now
put
this
planet
out
there
and
some
planet
be
bear
yesterday
some
be
bear
at
the
beginning
of
the
universe
you
do
not
know
when
in
the
time
line
of
a
planet
you
be
go
to
land
there
so
here
be
earth
throw
a
dart
at
the
time
line
most
of
the
time
the
dark
hit
earth
there
be
only
single
cell
life
wow
and
so
if
we
be
randomly
come
upon
planet
and
earth
be
any
measure
of
thing
single
cell
like
a
amoeba
yeah
we
spend
three
and
a
half
billion
year
as
single
cell
life
on
earth
and
then
we
have
something
call
the
Cambrian
explosion
of
life
the
chemistry
of
the
atmosphere
change
the
atmosphere
like
rocket
fuel
for
complex
life
and
life
now
have
the
cart
blanche
to
become
complex
because
the
system
can
support
it
and
now
you
get
limb
and
detector
like
eye
and
sensor
and
it
be
a
stunning
development
in
the
fossil
record
of
life
on
earth
and
so
then
you
will
have
complex
life
now
ask
so
that
be
a
smaller
piece
of
the
total
time
line
now
you
ask
how
often
do
you
throw
the
dart
will
you
find
intelligent
life
well
that
be
the
last
that
be
this
little
bit
that
we
define
as
intelligent
and
so
if
earth
be
any
measure
of
anything
throw
darts
at
planet
that
we
might
land
on
who
be
to
say
that
we
be
go
to
land
right
at
that
moment
where
what
we
call
intelligence
have
arise
maybe
that
planet
have
condition
that
be
especially
ripe
for
complex
life
and
they
start
complex
life
early
if
they
do
then
they
would
have
billion
of
year
to
develop
intelligent
life
and
if
that
be
the
case
it
be
quite
clear
to
I
that
if
they
observe
we
land
here
and
look
around
it
would
be
clear
they
that
there
be
no
scien
of
Intel
genlt
life
on
Earth
--
intelligent
life
on
earth
you
mean
if
they
land
and
look
around
no
it
be
just
not
what
we
would
describe
intelligent
life
not
what
we
be
look
for
we
do
not
want
to
mate
with
these
people
they
may
be
people
but
they
be
not
intelligent
exactly
yup
yup
what
be
on
Mars
Rover
be
on
Mars
I
be
happy
to
report
a
working
--
the
curiosity
rover
be
the
size
of
a
suv
still
project
yeah
yeah
so
what
be
up
there
well
Mars
be
--
water
Mars
the
martial
surface
have
rampant
evidence
of
there
once
have
have
run
water
so
that
say
something
yes
what
I
mean
by
evidence
I
mean
really
awesome
evidence
like
there
be
river
bed
that
meet
dry
I
anderr
river
bed
the
thing
if
you
fly
over
the
Midwest
and
look
at
thing
that
flood
water
have
do
and
long
time
river
have
do
cut
into
the
landscape
the
Grand
Canyon
kind
of
thing
you
see
all
of
these
telltale
feature
on
Mars
when
do
we
see
they
any
time
we
take
a
photograph
of
its
surface
so
we
could
have
know
that
without
go
there
no
the
resolution
be
very
hard
to
pick
up
that
be
hard
you
want
to
get
close
and
then
you
can
see
ridge
and
valley
and
mountain
that
tell
you
water
be
there
or
a
liquid
we
be
pretty
sure
it
be
water
but
certainly
a
liquid
and
by
the
way
to
I
ander
a
river
mean
the
river
be
there
for
some
time
right
you
do
not
I
ander
overnight
okay
it
be
a
slow
thing
river
do
not
only
that
there
be
dry
lake
bed
where
you
see
salt
deposit
at
the
bottom
and
how
do
you
get
salt
deposit
you
get
that
from
stand
water
that
have
mineral
deposit
in
it
the
water
evaporate
concentrate
the
mineral
deposit
and
when
there
be
no
water
leave
you
get
a
salt
lake
fly
over
Utah
that
be
what
Salt
Lake
Sphi
be
sit
next
to
should
we
go
to
Mars
yeah
why
not
it
be
feesable
and
doable
yeah
the
only
challenge
people
say
oh
the
radiation
we
have
clever
engineer
gure
out
all
the
technological
problem
it
be
money
just
money
be
it
really
oh
yeah
it
be
only
ever
money
at
all
time
be
you
su
preemly
disappoint
that
we
do
not
do
more
in
space
the
curiosity
part
of
I
be
disappointed
but
the
politically
astute
side
of
I
fully
understand
why
that
be
the
case
we
go
to
the
moon
--
we
be
have
other
priority
no
we
have
always
have
other
priority
so
that
be
a
false
excuse
when
we
go
to
the
moon
we
have
plenty
of
other
priority
there
be
a
civil
rights
movement
there
be
the
hot
war
in
Southeast
Asia
the
cold
war
with
the
Soviet
Union
campus
unrest
so
pr
we
do
it
because
we
be
at
war
that
be
a
act
of
war
essentially
without
the
weapon
and
if
we
be
not
at
war
the
motivation
to
go
to
the
moon
we
tell
ourselves
we
go
to
the
moon
because
we
be
Americans
we
be
explorer
and
it
be
in
we
dna
okay
that
might
all
be
true
but
the
people
who
write
the
check
do
not
give
a
rat
--
about
any
of
this
the
lofty
speak
it
be
be
you
security
at
risk
we
will
spend
any
amount
of
money
to
protect
that
and
that
be
when
money
flow
like
river
and
we
go
to
the
moon
in
that
climate
in
that
climate
but
should
we
create
that
kind
of
urgency
again
for
something
like
go
to
the
moon
you
know
what
I
joke
about
no
I
say
let
I
go
visit
China
and
whisper
to
the
head
of
China
psst
can
you
leak
a
memo
that
say
you
want
to
put
military
basis
on
Mars
do
not
tell
anybody
then
that
memo
show
up
in
the
Pentagon
we
will
be
on
Mars
in
ten
month
I
be
sure
one
month
to
design
build
and
fund
a
space
craft
and
nine
month
to
get
there
we
will
have
astronaut
that
be
how
motivated
I
think
we
would
be
because
that
be
how
motivated
we
be
back
in
the
1960
now
I
do
not
want
to
go
to
Mars
for
military
reason
I
think
there
be
a
strong
economic
reason
one
can
make
for
it
it
be
a
little
more
subtle
and
I
think
it
take
slightly
longer
than
the
proverbial
elevator
ride
that
you
have
to
save
up
for
you
member
of
Congress
this
take
maybe
twice
as
long
as
a
elevator
ride
and
I
be
think
I
vote
for
my
representation
in
Congress
I
want
they
to
listen
to
I
for
longer
than
a
elevator
ride
so
Itim
this
2016
will
be
unlike
any
other
2016
be
we
really
gon
na
do
this
we
have
no
choice
but
only
if
you
turn
resolution
into
reservation
make
this
2016
you
best
2016
ever
let
do
it
be
that
coffee
Yea
it
be
Nespresso
I
want
in
you
be
ready
get
ready
to
experience
a
cup
above
be
that
coffee
Nespresso
what
else
Jenny
and
Ryan
it
be
wonderful
from
shark
tank
happy
new
year
you
BOZOS
we
be
back
I
be
so
thrill
to
be
able
to
introduce
a
young
old
friend
of
mine
one
of
the
most
award
singer
in
any
genre
of
music
hard
to
believe
we
would
be
stand
here
now
twice
crazy
and
awesome
I
be
bless
you
ready
to
go
yes
with
a
medley
of
she
hit
the
one
and
only
Carrie
underwood
she
be
a
small-town
hard-working
woman
just
try
to
make
a
living
work
three
job
feed
four
little
mouth
in
a
run-down
kitchen
when
you
never
take
nothing
and
do
nothing
but
give
it
be
hard
to
be
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mom
and
a
good
Christian
she
say
I
do
not
drink
but
sometimes
I
need
a
stiff
drink
sip
from
a
highball
glass

Stephen

I
be
he
I
be
glad
you
be
all
sit
down
because
I
have
some
disturbing
news
to
report
about
we
president
I
be
sorry
to
say
this
but
I
want
to
talk
specifically
about
he
inability
to
keep
track
of
the
conflict
between
bloodthirsty
leader
in
the
unstable
region
of
Westeros
in
a
recent
interview
in
president
Obama
claim
he
love
game
of
throne
but
he
have
trouble
remember
the
name
of
any
of
the
character
in
fact
--
this
be
true
--
when
they
ask
he
he
favorite
character
he
say
--
and
I
quote
-
-
my
favorite
character
be
probably
the
dwarf
what
be
he
name
what
be
he
name
President
he
name
be
tyrion
lannister
of
the
House
lannister
youngest
son
of
Lord
Tywin
Lannister
what
be
he
name
one-time
richest
man
in
the
seven
kingdom
and
lord
paramount
of
the
westerland
I
think
you
follow
politics
Sir
it
do
not
make
any
sense
I
mean
how
you
can
survive
in
the
geopolitical
chess
game
if
you
can
not
tell
the
difference
between
tyrion
of
House
Lannister
and
say
jorah
mormont
son
of
jeor
mormont
of
House
Mormont
lord
of
Bear
Island
and
the
vassal
of
House
stark
in
the
north
you
be
asleep
at
the
wheel
President
you
be
asleep
at
the
wheel
you
be
tell
we
you
do
not
even
remember
hodor
name
well
I
guess
that
be
understandable
he
only
say
it
like
50
time
per
episode
but
perhaps
most
damning
of
all
be
what
president
Obama
say
next
and
again
I
quote
the
only
one
I
remember
be
Jon
Snow
because
I
can
pronounce
Jon
Snow
Sir
sir
that
be
add
insult
to
Jon
Snow
fatal
injury
oh
sorry

alert

I
strongly
advise

you
start
watch
a
little
more
closely
President
we
be
count
on
you
to
bring
peace
to
the
seven
kingdom

of

Harper
bazaar
WOO-HOO

anymore
because
they
be
get

all
the
way
nude
here

I
do
have
a
necklace
on
that
be
true
that
be
just
because
it
be
chilly
it
be
it
be
how
do
you
--
how
do
you
get
the
confidence
to
you
know
let
it
all
hang
out
shall
we
say
because
I
be
51
year
old
and
I
will
not
let
anybody
see
I
without
sock
on
at
this
point
where
do
you
--
do
you
have
web
foot
or
something
no
but
I
have
that
thing
where
you
wear
sock
too
long
and
there
be
no
hair
from
--
you
know
what
I
be
talk
about
where
it
pull
all
the
hair
out
I
have
old
man
ankle
I
do
not
want
people
to
see
that
it
be
kind
of
like
trucker
arm
with
the
Tan
you
have
a
three
-
decade-long
career
now
and
you
do
not
seem
to
you
know
be
faze
at
all
by
what
have
be
Hollywood
traditional
say
not
most
warm
embrace
actress
as
they
reach
they
50s
you
just
keep
trucking
you
know
I
think
the
key
to
happiness
be
to
first
accept
yourself
and
I
think
we
have
to
accept
ourselves
for
who
we
be
and
by
the
time
you
be
in
you
50s
you
get
ta
like
it
or
then
what
I
think
if
you
want
to
like
other
you
have
to
like
yourself
I
think
there
be
a
paramount
to
like
there
and
it
be
also
good
to
like
the
airbrusher
oh
really
I
get
ta
get
I
one
of
those
that
will
be
great
airbrusher
okay
you
be
my
idea
of
a
movie
star
you
have
do
huge
movie
thank
you
you
have
be
nominate
for
golden
globe
nominate
for
oscar
you
have
really
stretch
yourself
now
you
new
show
which
we
be
also
executive
producing
be
call
agent
agent
x
TNT
Sunday
night
at
that
be
the
executive
producer
talk
that
be
not
the
actress
that
be
the
executive
producer
I
be
proud
of
it
you
should
be
it
be
base
on
this
premise
about
something
we
do
not
be
the
vice
president
explain
what
the
vice
president
find
out
the
first
day
the
vice
president
come
into
office
in
agent
I
think
what
happen
to
anyone
who
become
president
or
vice
president
be
they
be
pretty
surprise
on
day
one
because
I
do
not
think
anybody
know
what
it
really
be
like
in
the
case
of
we
show
the
vice
president
find
out
there
be
a
clause
in
the
constitution
that
she
do
not
know
about
which
say
that
--
and
it
be
so
that
when
the
vice
president
be
swear
in
they
say
something
different
than
the
president
which
be
that
they
swear
to
protect
the
country
against
enemy
foreign
and
domestic
and
in
this
case
she
do
that
by
dispatch
a
secret
agent
who
be
super
handsome
and
cute
he
be
a
guy
name
Jeff
Hephner
who
play
we
agent
you
play
the
vice
president
and
the
constitution
say
basically
you
have
you
own
one-man
hit
squad
you
can
send
out
to
kill
people
yeah
do
not
Dick
Cheney
have
that
already
I
think
Dick
Cheney
be
he
own
one-man
hit
squad
yeah
in
this
world
do
not
the
president
know
that
the
vice
president
have
this
like
one
-
man
hit
squad
well
here
be
the
thing
in
this
world
we
president
be
a
former
vice
president
so
of
course
he
know
so
he
know
all
right
but
he
can
not
talk
to
I
about
it
now
that
he
be
president
he
have
to
pretend
he
have
presidential
amnesia
you
know
how
man
get
that
here
be
a
clip
from
the
show
and
it
be
I
believe
the
agent
at
the
time
--
what
be
the
agent
name
agent
x
John
Case
you

I
you

everything
you
need
to
know
from
comedy
in
watch
those
season
that
be
very
nice
and
it
be
a
enormous
influence
on
I
I
like
you
even
more
than
Sharon
stone
right
now
and
she
be
not
here
you
also
in
season
two
--
-lrb-
laughter
-rrb-
now
you
hate
I
more
than
Sharon
stone
no
no
no
I
love
it
you
beat
I
to
the
punch
now
you
be
also
the
star
of
the
leftovers
on
HBO
this
be
season
two
for
people
who
do
not
know
out
there
2
%
of
the
population
have
disappear
right
2
%
or
3
%
of
the
population
vanish
mysteriously
in
unknown
circumstance
and
that
be
a
bad
thing
it
be
a
horrifying
thing
at
least
to
the
people
on
my
show
it
be
a
horrible
thing
and
it
be
--
everyone
really
depressed
that
they
be
the
one
who
be
leave
behind
and
not
know
what
be
happen
in
the
world
I
think
it
be
the
not
know
where
people
go
that
make
people
depress
--
it
be
the
not
know
what
happen
when
thing
be
unexplained
or
mystery
be
unexplained
it
create
frustration
or
anxiety
in
people
which
it
much
like
life
when
people
die
or
go
away
the
show
have
a
amazing
tension
when
you
watch
it
you
feel
the
enormous
weight
and
almost
the
guilt
that
people
have
that
they
be
still
there
and
the
other
people
be
go
yeah
be
it
depressing
to
shoot
yeah
the
first
season
we
keep
it
really
serious
and
sort
of
quiet
on
the
set
keep
the
camera
roll
the
second
season
we
realize
we
would
all
throw
ourselves
off
cliffs
if
we
do
not
create
some
levity
on
the
set
one
of
the
thing
some
of
you
director
have
say
David
Lynch
for
instance
have
say
you
can
tell
how
hard
-
-
you
can
actually
see
the
thought
on
the
face
of
Justin
Theroux
that
you
can
really
see
the
thinking
of
Justin
Theroux
when
he
be
not
talk
like
you
can
see
the
wheel
turn
so
I
guess
it
be
a
nice
thing
to
say
when
I
hear
that
--
also
other
director
have
say
that
about
you
too
yeah
I
think
you
know
in
a
lot
of
we
--
we
have
a
lot
of
linger
kind
of
shot
where
you
be
have
to
try
to
tell
the
story
through
you
eye
and
also
a
lot
of
you
know
--
you
can
only
--
there
be
many
way
to
do
sort
of
the
anguish
or
the
different
version
of
the
pain
that
these
people
be
in
I
think
a
lot
of
we
on
the
show
do
the
same
thing
you
know
where
you
be
have
to
tell
the
story
with
you
face
but
not
everyone
have
you
eyebrow
no
I
have
be
know
to
act
with
my
eyebrow
as
well
could
I

I
challenge
you
to
a
eyebrow
act
contest
I
accept
that
challenge
thank

my
eyebrow

three
year

and
this
be
you
29th
studio
album
yes
indeed
it
be
29
album
do
you
ever
think
that
be
a
lot
of
record
well
it
be
a
lot
of
fun
as
well
yeah
exactly
but
29
I
would
think
probably
around
10
15
you
go
--
get
bore
no
but
you
go
that
be
a
lot
of
record
do
you
ever
think
you
would
make
29
record
no
when
I
start
out
I
sure
do
not
but
you
know
--
have
it
be
up
and
downs
you
sell
a
lot
of
album
one
week
and
not
the
next
so
you
just
get
to
keep
pile
through
yeah
the
most
important
thing
be
I
enjoy
it
and
I
think
it
show
oh
my
gosh
absolutely
you
be
the
best
you
be
the
--
last
time
it
be
fantastic
I
mean
every
time
you
come
on
you
be
the
best
but
this
be
like
--
well
if
you
say
so
well
I
mean
yeah
you
do
not
want
to
be
a
singer
at
first
though
right
you
be
a
little
shy
when
you
start
yeah
I
be
I
remember
we
have
singing
lesson
at
school
and
the
singing
teacher
use
to
pick
on
I
say
Stewart
Oy
come
over
here
I
want

you
own

it
get
so
bad
I
would
be
off

be
paranoid
about
have
to
sing
in

of
people
yeah

now
look
at
you
you
sing
in
front
of
stadium
still
bloody
nervous
no
you
be
not
but
this
be
call
another
country
and
I
think
the
tricky
part
of
the
title
be
that
you
never
make
a
country
album
and
this
one
be
not
country
at
all
so
that
be
the
fun
of
it

neither
be
another

album

be
it
country
music

it
be
another

Lady

they
only
allow
one
visitor
at
a
time
unless
there
be
a
special
reason
it
may
help
for
they
to
see
that
the
family
think
she
innocent
so
the
sacrifice
could
be
worth
it
I
would
cut
my
arm
off
if
I
think

would
do
any
good
oh

do
not
think
that
would
be
sensible

can
not
have
you
wobbly
at
both
end
they

not
go

wrong
with
a
margaux

where
be
the

if
we
be
offer
bed
and
breakfast
there
should
be
someone
there
to
run
it
oh
I
do
not
know
we
should
go
and
look
at
they
and
then
we
will
talk
be
it
worth
speak
to
Murray
again
before
we
go
why
can
not
he
just
get
she
out
he
say
they
have
uncover
something

check
every
piece
of
luggage
when
they
be
transfer
in
York
I
have
change
train
before
Carson
I
be
impressed
you
should
come
to
say
goodbye
mama
why
do
you
always
talk
of
I
as
if
I
be
a
salmon
who
lay
my

then
swim
back
to

with

conductor
all
aboard
it

all
in
you
hand
Carson
may
they
prove
worthy
of
the
charge
m
Lord
Lord
Sinderby
Branson
and
Barrow
not
what
I
would
call
a
recipe
for
a
peaceful
week
shooting
make
you
wonder
what
they
will
be
shoot
at
by
the
end
of
it
so
Daisy
what
be
you
work
at
while
they
be
away
I
have
not
decide
yet
you
do
not
sound
very
keen
to
be
honest
sometimes
I
be
not
sure
I
should
go
on
with
it
I
mean
what
be
I
try
to
prove
oh
dear
we
be
not
have
another
crisis
be
we
no
but
the
more
I
think
about
it
the
more
I
wonder
how
realistic
be
my
plan
will
not
it
make
more
sense
now
to
just
get
on
with
my
life
Patmore
what
be
you
do
in
here
oh
I
come
up
for
a
bit
of
air

be
nice
to
get
you
head
above

for
five
minute
-lrb-
train
chugging
-rrb-
now
for
rose
sake
we
must
all
be
on
we
best
behavior
I
agree
Sinderby
always
look
as
if
he
be
spoil
for
a
fight
whether
he
be
or
not
so
we
must
all
be
careful
not
to
give
he
grounds
for
one
I
wonder
if
I
be
right
to
come
I
do
not
want
to
sound
like
Larry
Grey
but
I
be
not
Lord
Sinderby
idea
of
the
perfect
son-in-law
wleys
stick
together
for
once
I
agree
with
Mary

will
enjoy
it
when
you
get
there
besides
you
be
a
good
shot
any
host
will
forgive
a
lot
if
you
get
the
number
up
what
be
it
can
I
do
anything
to
help
yes
stop
fuss
Edith
I
suggest
to
nanny
that
she
take
the
child
to
Lake
Gormire
for
a
picnic
but
do
you
think
it
too
dangerous
should
I
telephone
to
cancel
it
why
do
not
you
just
shut
they
up
in
a
box
in
the
attic
and
let
they
out
when
they
be
21
do
not
be
unkind
well
honestly
I
be
the
mother
around
here
and
I
be
not
panic
so

I
would
say

list

how
do
you
find
the
servant
generally
be

I
would
rather

reason

suspect
some
of
they

strong
principle
except
when
it

Sinderby
how
true
you

I
be
wonder

find
out
about
Tom
background
and
now
he
be
punish
he
for
it

before
my
mother

give
it
to
I
as
a
wedding
present
when
I
be
a

make
the
most
delicious
chicken
broth
and
serve
it
in
this
DENKER
there
be
nothing
better
than
chicken
broth
as
a
pick-me-up
no
and
it
really
be
delicious
I
remember
it
to
this
day
she
use
to
say
every
good
lady
maid
should
know
how
to
make
a
restorative
broth
those
day

be
afraid
quite
go
eh
Miss
Denker

would
agree

not
be
jealous
when
Denker
be
say

can
cook
I
be
not

can
if
we
must
but
I
just
do
not
see
why
we
be
in
such
a
hurry
I
will
be
off
first
thing
if
that
be
all
right
Carson
I
would
love
to
give
you
something
to
take
for
she
but
they
would
not
let
she
keep
it
thank
you
Hughes
but
it
be
know
that
we
be
think
of
she
that
be
what
count
poor
Bates
what
a
nightmare
he
must
be
live
through
at
least
they
let
he
visit
a
lot
only
until

Lord

under
my
roof
papa
only
say
he

a
good
shot
and

Lord
Sinderby
now
that
we
be
family
would
not
it
be
better
just
to
accept
the
situation
of
Rose
parent

not
it
make
it
pleasanter
for
everyone
I
can
not
pretend
to
approve
of
divorce
even
for

and
you
can
not
learn
to
live
with
it
even
for
Rose
sake
do
you
shoot
as
a
boy
I
use
to
shoot
pigeon
on
my
grandfather
farm

very
difficult
thank
you

it
hard
join
they
family
hard
enough
Sybil
be
dead
and
I
have
to
do
it
on
my
own
they
seem
much
more
welcome
than
we
be
I
be
still
a
shock
to
the
system
Daniel
Sinderby
be
a
prig
I
suppose
Rachel
just
want
we
all
to
be
friend
but
in
she
husband
case
she
have
such
poor
material
to
work
with

what
be
it
where
do
you
go
IN
YORK
ah

but
so
be
seven
million
other
people

be
not

have
find
something
out
about
I
that
be
nonsense
it
can
not
be
anything
that
matter
I
should
have

you
and
I
feel
badly
about

now
you
know
my
father
be
a
laborer
and
he
be
kill
in
a
accident
at
work
yes
when
I
be
about

and
I
and
my
sister
and
mother
be
leave
destitute
until
she
marry
again
and
you
stepfather
be
a
iron
worker
I
know
all
this
not
all
of
it
it
be
not
much
at
first
slight
touch
brushing
past
I
I
still
remember
the
smell
of
the
beer
on
he
breath
could
not
you
tell
you
mother
she
do
not
want
to
believe
it
what
would
she
have
do
if
he
would
leave
then
one
night
he
keep
look
at
I
and
I
know
what
be
come
so
I
fetch
a
knife
from
the
scullery
and
I
wait
in
the
dark
be
you
say
you
kill
he
no
no
of
course
not
I
threaten
he
and
when
he
would
not
stop
I
strike
he
with
the
blade
but
I
only
cut
he
you
mean
nothing
happen
well
he
scream
blue
murder
so
the
watch
come
but
my
mother
persuade
he
to
say
he
slip
and
fall
that
it
be
a
accident
after
that
I
take
a
job
further
up
north
as
a
tweeny
but
it
must
have
be
in
the
record
and
now
they
have
find
it
either
that
or
he
hear
I
be
in
prison
and
tell
they
you
be
not
guilty
so
there
must
be
a
way
to
prove
it
do
you
never
doubt
I
once
ask
you
that
question
and
my
answer
be
the
same
as
yours
I
do
not
doubt
but
I
do
not
doubt
that
the
sun
will
rise
in
the
east
either
thank
you
Edith
I
wonder
what
the
child
be
do
now
not
worry
about
we
you
be
right
of
course
I
be
sure
they
be
be
spoil
to
death
of
course
they
be
might
I
have
some
bread
thank
you
stowell
you
be
very
kind
I
do
apologize
poor
atticus
how
can
he
reprimand
he
father
butler
Lord
sinderby
would
not
take
kindly
to
that
but
the
silly
thing
be
I
do
not
think
stowell
even
like
my
father-in-law
he
seem
obsequious
enough
oh
he
be
all
bow
and
deference
to
he
face
but
my
maid
tell
I
it
be
a
different
story
behind
he
back
that
be
a
frightening
thought
when
you
remember
what
a
Butler
know
about
the
family
he
serve
they
all
know
far
more
about
we
than
we
do
about
they
well
it
be
nice
but
it
would
take
a
lot
to
get
it
up
to
a
standard
where
we
could
charge
money
to
stay
there
oh
not
so
much
we
would
employ
the
estate
worker
and
I
would
supervise
while
I
would
be
supervise
the
mythical
maid
of
all
work
we
would
share
the
duty
but
that
be
the
whole
point
all
right
where
be
the
next
one
we
will
take
the
bus
to
Helmsley
and
then
it
be
a
bit
of
a
hike
keep
calm
I
be
not
dead
yet
it
be
kind
of
you
to
send
a
motor
car
we
do
not
want
you
to
get
lose
where
be
the
princess
she
be
upstairs
change
we
have
not
see
she
yet
any
of
we
I
borrow
this
from
the
theatre
royal
oh
well
shall
we
be
you
sure
you
would
not
rather
greet
she
in
a
room
by
yourself
we
can
always
scoot
back
no
no
it
will
be
easier
not
to
be
alone
at
first
I
have
not
see
she
for
five
year
I
want
you
all
here
the
presence
of
stranger
be
we
only
guarantee
of
good
behavior
I
hate
the
way
stowell
treat
Branson
he
be
not
polite
downstairs
he
do
not
approve
of
Branson
better
himself
what
right
have
he
to
approve
or
disapprove
anyway
lady
rise
say
he
do
not
even
like
Lord
Sinderby
I
be
not
sure
he
lordship
be
very
easy
to
like
true
enough
but
be
there
any
way
to
get
stowell
a
black
mark
can
not
barrow
come
up
with
something
you
be
right
Barrow
usually
have
a
card
or
two
up
he
sleeve
well
tell
he
to
get
one
out
of
he
sleeve
and
play
it
Pronto
I
do
not
mind
take
he
down
a
peg
or
two
but
how
hmm
let
I
think
about
it
while
I
be
clean
these
that
remind
I
have
you
see
Lord
Sinderby
Valet
why
I
have
run

can
find
Lord
Sinderby
valet
daunt
he
be
go
out

a
idea

Mary
would
mind
annoying
lord
sinderby
into
the
bargain
none
of
we
lot
would
mind
and
will
you
help
I
I
suppose
so
see
as
it
be
what
lady
Mary
ask
for
then
there
be
you
answer
I
do
not
understand
you
will
we

piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
come

you
wish

what
difference
will
it
make
you
have
have
a
long
journey

would
so
like
to
go
to

have
no
possession
to
put
in
my
luggage

we
just
be
grateful
to
lady
grantham
hmm
last
time

meet
the
circumstance

rather
different

they
will
not
trace
it
back
to
we
I
be
not
a
complete
amateur
Miss

proud
chap

I

sad

a
immoral
proposition
from
a
man
be
I
so
wrong
to
savor

chest
well
in
my
chest
in

in

sharp
so
I
go
to

would
hear
about
in
York

say
I
have
--
well
I
might
have
--
angina
oh
my
God
this
be
why
I
do
not
want
to

it
do
not

be
about
to
drop
down
dead
of

heart
attack
but

how
relaxing
this
whole
trip
be
oh
that
be
unpleasant
be
not
it
to
see
a
man
shout
at
he
butler
I
think
I
will
speak
to
edith
why
now
well
you
never
know
what
be
come
do
you
I
want
to
make
it
clear
that
everything
all
right
between
we
please
look
after
yourself
but
that
be
you
job
my
darling
and
you
do
it
so
well
Crawley
say
how
much
she
enjoy
the
evening
m
lady
it
be
colorful
thank
Potter
for
the
Delicious
dinner
but
please
tell
she
I
need
a
rest
from
such
rich
delight
be
you
ready
to
go
up
m
lady
yes
what
about
some
of
Miss
Denker
famous
broth
I
be
aware
that
you
be
tease
Spratt
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
be
very
nice
Miss
Denker
will
you
take
up
the
challenge
of
the
wooden
spoon
oh
would
not
I
be
in
Potter
way
I
would
never
want
to
be
a
nuisance
I
bet
you
would
not
and
there
be
a
stove
in
the
still
room
could
you
manage
with
that
denker
I
would
be
delighted
m
lady
you
see
Spratt
not
every
spring
and
lever
obey
you
touch
come
in
papa
be
something
the
matter
no
nothing
be
the
matter
and
that
be
what
I
want
to
make
clear
I
do
not
understand
what
be
this
about
marigold
I
see
and
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
marigold
I
think
you
know
what
I
want
to
say
what
I
want
you
to
say
I
can
not
give
she
up
of
course
not
have
you
tell
Tom
no
but
he
might
have
guess
so
now
everyone
know
everyone
except
Mary
I
want
you
forgiveness
papa
Am
I
allow
to
say
that
still
it
be
not
the
way
I
would
have
have
thing
I
will
not
lie
to
you
about
that
but
this
be
what
be
happen
I
believe
Michael
Gregson
be
a
honorable
man
oh
he
be
papa
he
really
be
he
would
have
marry
I
as
soon
as
he
could
I
know
that
I
think
so
too
so
now
we
must
do
we
best
for
he
child
for
he
sake
as
well
as
yours
that
be
so
lovely
of
you
but
I
think
we
should
keep
it
in
the
family
even
in
1924
there
be
plenty
of
people
who
might
be
unpleasant
but
do
you
forgive
I
papa
oh
my
darling
I
be
sure
I
need
you
forgiveness
quite
as
much
as
you
need
mine
now
go
to
bed
and
sleep
well
I
gather
you
get
more
than
you
bargain
for
I
have
have
my
run-in
with
he
lordship
before
but
I
have
never
be
insult
in
public
and
I
do
not
intend
to
start
now
still
Stowell
get
a
flea
in
he
ear
and
that
be
what
we
want
what
you
and
lady
Mary
want
perhaps
I
have
get
bigger
plan
now
what
do
you
mean
oh
you
will
see
yes
what
do
you
want
to
add
my
sympathy
Stowell
he
insult
I
and
all
you
know
I
feel
for
you
and
I
think
you
show
great
restraint
for
a
servant
in
that
situation
restraint
be
Hobson
choice
write
something
how
do
you
mean
write
something
my
name
be
Barrow
and
I
live
in
Yorkshire
it
be
not
you
then
why
would
it
be
I
the
staff
resent
I
they
Butler
on
holiday
and
they
hate
take
order
from
I
that
do
not
give
he
lordship
much
excuse
to
behave
as
he
do
he
lordship
he
lordship
with
a
title
that
be
not
ten
minute
old
I
know
a
lot
about
he
dirty-fingered
lordship
and
he
be
forget
that
I
expect
you
could
tell
I
thing
he
would
not
much
like
to
read
on
the
front
page
of
the
time
you
would
be
surprise
go
on
then
surprise
I
Edith
it
be
a
shame
lord
sinderby
would
not
come
ATTICUS
mother
do
ask
he
she
think
it
might
get
rid
of
some
of
the
nasty
taste
of
last
night
but
he
say
no
he
be
a
difficult
man
or
should
not
I
say
that
you
can
say
what
you
like
after
that
dinner
oh
well
at
least
we
give
the
county
something
to
talk
about
I
wonder
what
the
truth
be
about
the
letter
from
the
valet
well
Baxter
say
it
be
one
of
the
castle
staff
they
hate
stowell
Branson
they
will
hear
no
argument
from
I
well
it
be
over
now
why
be
you
all
in
a
huddle
at
breakfast
Atticus
have
be
offer
a
job
in
New
York
oh
congratulation
thank
you
be
not
you
go
to
America
soon
I
be
I
be
go
to
Boston
when

be
plan
to
spend
Christmas
at
Downton
and
leave
in
the
new
year
well
it
have
not
be
decide
yet
poor
Mary
she
hate
to
be
leave
behind
when
everyone
else
be
get
on
with
they
life
it
be
not
that
it
be
the
thought
of
be
leave
behind
with
you
but
you
can
not
manage
a
broth
Miss
Denker
special
or
otherwise
well
of
course
I
would
be
very
good
at
it
if
you
only
know
where
to
start
I
should
never
have
volunteer
but
if
you
would
see
the
look
on
Spratt
face
you
would
have
swear
you
could
paint
the
Mona
Lisa
and
be
finish
by
teatime
will
not
Potter
help
I
do
not
trust
she
I
think
she
be
in
league
with
the
enemy
oh
blimey
we
would
all
better
come
and
work
at
the
Dower
House
it
sound
a
lot
more
exciting
than
here
how
much
attention
will
they
pay
to
Bates
past
well
you
can
see
the
problem
a
man
attack
she
and
she
stab
he
with
a
knife
now
there
be
another
attack
and
she
push
he
to
he
death
on
a
busy
road
there
be
a
pattern
if
that
be
what
you
think
then
why
be
you
here
Bates
please
I
hope
we
have
not
leave
we
manners
outside
the
prison
gate
of
course
you
stepfather
do
not
bring
a
charge
against
you
that
be
my
mother
do
but
it
may
mean
that
we
can
have
it
rule
as
inadmissible
that
would
undermine
they
case
and
it
might
never
come
to
a
trial
but
can
you
achieve
such
a
ruling
I
will
do
everything
I
can
you
seem
to
think
I
be
angry
with
you
son
I
be
not
at
all
then
why
can
not
we
forget
that
horrible
evening
ever
happen
I
be
not
angry
with
they
but
I
accept
that
they
have
no
desire
to
see
they
mother
replace
this
be
my
fault
I
have
take
such
care
to
shield
they
from
the
truth
which
be
I
be
wretched
with
they
mother
perhaps
she
be
wretched
with
you
no
doubt
we
be
very
ill-suited
but
now
they
be
prevent
my
first
chance
of
real
happiness
I
be
sorry
but
I
be
not
prepare
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
in
a
atmosphere
of
loathing
and
resentment
I
will
not
come
between
a
father
and
he
son
then
may
I
ask
you
to
be
honest
be
that
the
only
barrier
if
they
be
to
welcome
you
into
the
family
you
would
marry
I
I
would
and
I
should
be
very
glad
to
so
there
be
my
challenge
DENKER
how
do
you
get
rid
of
all
this
scum
PATMORE
it
be
the
onion
they
be
only
suppose
to
sweat
but
I
think
they
fall
down
exhaust
and
you
go
a
bit
mad
with
the
salt
shall
we
taste
it
oh
my
God
why
do
not
I
just
make
a
bottle
of
it
then
I
could
bring
it
to
the
house
you
could
warm
it
through
and
serve
it
no
one
will
ever
know
and
for
now
we
could
give
you
all
the
ingredient
so
you
could
chop
they
about
for
Spratt
benefit
I
will
use
every
precedent
there
be
but
if
the
story
be
admit
as
evidence
will
she
be
convict
where
the
law
be
concern
you
can
never
be
sure
about
anything
will
she
they
have
a
strong
motive
and
they
can
prove
opportunity
because
she
be
in
London
which
we
do
not
deny
no
now
she
be
be
identify
on
the
pavement
nearby
at
that
moment
and
they
will
use
the
earlier
case
to
prove
it
be
not
against
she
nature
it
be
quite
strong
I
be
afraid
the
cook
happy
for
you
to
announce
dinner
thank
you
Barrow
I
be
afraid
I
say
too
much
last
night
I
be
angry
and
I
would
have
more
to
drink
than
be
good
for
I
oh
do
not
worry
about
that
Stowell
I
have
get
a
mind
like
a
sieve
that
be
dinner
everyone
will
you
shoot
tomorrow
or
have
you
give
way
to
the
uninvited
guest
I
do
not
think
I
have
a
choice
you
can
have
my
place
certainly
not
I
have
have
two
good
day
and
we
be
out
again
on
Friday
so
I
do
not
merit
pity
I
hope
you
neighbor
know
how
accommodate
you
be
be
you
can
tell
he
if
you
like
he
be
stay
the
night
so
you
will
have
plenty
of
opportunity
do
not
tempt
I
I
do
find
it
astonishing
the
way
people
take
these
thing
for
grant
we
can
not
all
be
as
unselfish
as
you
Mary
just
joking
you
will
like
this
it
be
not
dear
but
I
think
it
be
very
good
value
I
have
do
the
sum
and
I
believe
we
should
put
a
offer
in
on
the
house
on
brouncker
road
before
I
agree
to
be
part
of
it
I
hope
you
will
agree
to
we
future
as
property
magnate
very
well
I
can
see
there
be
no
escape
and
I
must
tell
the
truth
I
have
never
catch
you
in
a
lie
no
I
do
not
lie
but
there
be
thing
I
do
not
say
I
have
allow
this
folly
to
go
on
because
I
do
not
know
really
because
it
be
a
nice
idea
and
I
would
have
like
to
come
in
with
you
I
would
have
but
you
will
not
I
will
not
because
I
can
not
I
do
not
know
if
I
have
ever
tell
you
that
I
have
a
sister
I
always
think
you
have
no
family
leave
which
may
be
because
that
be
what
I
want
you
to
think
my
sister
Becky
be
bear
she
be
not
quite
right
in
the
head
while
my
mother
be
alive
she
look
after
she
but
when
she
die
there
be
no
one
but
you
precisely
my
choice
be
simple
either
I
give
up
work
and
we
live
on
a
pittance
or
I
go
on
work
and
pay
for
she
to
be
care
for
but
that
must
have
cost
a
fortune
it
cost
every
penny
I
could
spare
so
there
you
have
it
I
have
get
no
savings
because
I
have
get
no
money
I
be
a
pauper
but
what
about
you
retirement
have
you
not
pay
into
any
scheme
I
can
not
retire
I
must
work
for
as
long
as
anyone
will
let
I
I
wish
you
very
well
with
you
house
Carson
you
have
earn
it
but
there
be
no
place
for
I
in
the
project
now
I
have
embarrass
you

be
not
embarrassed

be
ashamed
that
I
chivy
and
bully

if
I
would
have
any
sensitivity
at
all
no
do
not
say
that
I

enjoy
we
little
dream
I
be
the
one
to
blame
for

so
great
now
before
we
talk
about
sister
I
feel
like
this
might
have
be
one
of
the
inspiration
because
you
play
the
Bush
sister
--
you
play
the
Bush
girl
in
2005
yes
twin
we
kind
of
do
look
like
they
too
yeah
I
think
yeah
and
they
do
not
look
like
each
other
no
that
be
perfect
because
this
be
actually
like
the
two
single
bed
this
be
actually
in
the
film
sister
because
you
--
tell
we
about
the
movie
real
quick
we
sleep
in
two
single
bed
oh
keep
go
no
it
be
a
movie
about
--
we
be
grow
woman
who
be
kind
of
disconnect
and
not
very
content
in
we
life
and
we
adult
parent
decide
to
sell
we
childhood
home
and
we
come
back
to
throw
one
last
rager
the
party
that
we
never
have
in
high
school
and
in
do
so
learn
stuff
about
ourselves
we
learn
thing
about
ourselves
and
we
grow
oh
that
be
good
can
not
hear
myself
because
audience
want
to
see
that
they
like
to
see
character
grow
and
change
you
be
talk
too
loud
I
do
not
think
so
you
play
--
you
be
sort
of
the
button
up
sister
yep
you
be
kind
of
the
party
animal
sister
yes
I
play
sort
of
the
wreck
ball
sister
who
be
the
single
mom
always
out
of
work
always
cause
trouble
and
it
be
fun
for
I
because
I
never
get
to
play
that
even
for
one
second
of
my
real
life
right
do
you
channel
--
anyone
who
know
I
know
that
I
be
not
fun
at
all
like
not
--
you
be
like
a
half
a
glass
of
red
wine
of
be
a
total
disaster
at
every
party
I
have
be
at
with
you
I
do
go
out
to
dinner
with
you
guy
one
time
right
before
the
golden
globe
and
do
not
eat
really
that
much
that
day
and
just
get
hammer
and
it
be
really
funny
because
for
as
long
as
I
have
know
you
I
can
not
clock
it
it
be
like
a
total
--
all
of
a
sudden
the
cloud
go
by
a
full
moon
and
then
you
be
immediately
a
werewolf
you
be
like
--
like
ask
for
thing
from
the
wrong
waiter
it
be
fantastic
yeah
do
you
--
you
party
it
up
House
party
back
in
the
day
hey
dude
do
not
point
to
I
and
say
you
party
it
up
be
you
mad
that
it
be
past
tense
yeah
I
party
still
I
do
but
you
know
kind
of
tame
suburban
nonsense
but
certainly
have
a
few
party
in
my
day
and
you
know
thing
like
--
have
the
towel
rack
pull
down
in
my
bathroom
or
people
hide
beer
in
my
wash
machine
just
--
white
girl
stuff
Gotcha
now
you
each
have
brother
yeah
right
you
have
two
girl
yes
you
have
two
boy
yes
they
be
at
the
age
now
10
and
4
8
and
5
be
that
right
yes
well
play
yes
can
you
clock
now
how
they
might
party
when
the
House
party
start
OOH
yeah
my
little
one
be
trou-ble
she
be
go
to
bring
it
she
be
trouble
yeah
it
be
gon
na
be
hard
I
have
a
friend
who
tell
she
10-year-old
son
that
he
be
allergic
to
marijuana
and
if
he
try
it
he
would
throw
up
and
he
just
accept
it
and
then
when
he
be
17
he
friend
be
like
who
tell
you
that
and
he
go
home
and
say
do
you
lie
to
I
and
she
be
like
yeah
and
I
think
that
--
I
might
do
that
you
might
take
that
step
you
might
go
full
lie
top
to
bottom
lie
of
course
I
like
that
style
I
think
people
do
not
lie
to
they
child

each
other
as
--
you
guy
be
like

would
you
say
you
have
a
shorthand

think

the
way

think
if
we

Seth

art
director
so
there
be
like
there
be
you

then
there
be
like
five
DICKS
on

go
to
go
through
all
of
they
start
with
the
best
and
worst
in
the
world
of
big
news
it
be
a
year
of
first
I
think
a
lot
of
people
who
predict
a
lot
of
thing
be
wrong
I
can
not
believe
it
be
the
end
of
the
year
already
it
be
be
weird
some
weird
stuff
happen
kind
of
horrifying
in
term
of
some
headline
the
worst
way
to
start
come
in
the
first
few
day
of
January
with
the
terror
attack
on
the
french
paper
Charlie
Hebdo
add
in
the
attack
on
Paris
later
and
indeed
around
the
world
and
you
get
the
worst
story
of
the
year
the
persistent
plague
of
terrorism
there
be
no
doubt
we
be
deal
here
with
a
very
different
beast
something
that
we
have
not
see
before
something
which
do
not
follow
any
form
of
normal
social
norm
or
even
even
by
the
perversion
of
terrorism
this
be
absolutely
out
of
the
pale
you
feel
hopeless
you
feel
scared
all
you
can
do
be
post
a
picture
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
inside
a
peace
sign
and
put
it
on
instagram
what
else
can
you
do
the
official
response
to
Isis
more
than
coalition
air
strike
since
they
begin
last
year
include
one
that
official
say
kill
the
infamous
Jihadi
John
and
the
best
personal
reaction
to
it
all
that
boy
that
Dad
vicious
assault
come
closer
to
home
Mass
shooting
rock
a
school
in
Oregon
a
planned
parenthood
clinic
in
Colorado
and
many
other
place
include
San
Bernardino
California
where
a
shooting
at
a
office
gathering
as
the
year
wind
down
reignite
fear
of
domestic
terrorism
any
time
you
hear
about
a
mass
shooting
whether
it
be
a
school
or
a
church
it
be
like
really
really
sad
it
go
to
show
you
that
sometimes
you
be
not
in
control
in
Charleston
South
Carolina
a
massacre
at
a
church
prayer
meeting
strike
many
people
very
hard
what
be
so
uplifting
and
amazing
actually
be
I
be
go
to
say
they
faith
in
action
that
congregation
afterward
amazing
grace
how
sweet
the
sound
most
graceful
move
in
the
aftermath
the
relatively
swift
step
by
South
Carolina
to
bow
to
pressure
and
take
the
rebel
flag
off
of
permanent
official
display
that
feel
like
one
of
those
like
problem
come
up
we
ban
it
it
be
over
with
and
as
a
society
it
feel
like
we
be
like
next
next
problem
not
exactly
this
year
the
worst
domestic
problem
that
seem
almost
unsolvable
racial
tension
we
be
hear
again
and
again
from
the
african-american
community
be
they
do
not
feel
as
if
they
be
be
treat
equally
or
with
the
respect
by
law
enforcement
as
everyone
else
in
Baltimore
the
death
of
a
black
man
in
police
custody
set
off
day
of
unrest
other
case
in
other
place
follow
many
of
they
shocking
and
poll
now
show
almost
half
of
all
Americans
think
race
be
a
big
problem
that
be
a
20-year
high
and
as
police
inquiry
mount
--
it
use
to
be
more
than
just
lay
people
off
suspend
without
pay
more
than
that
that
be
not
enough
because
they
need
to
be
make
a
example
out
of
they
need
to
fear
the
repercussion
of
treat
people
as
though
they
be
not
human
being
the
worst
backlash
police
officer
seemingly
be
target
shoot
at
and
in
some
case
kill
once
that
happen
I
be
so
afraid
because
if
everyone
be
rebel
against
the
police
then
who
be
go
to
protect
we
worst
case
of
try
too
hard
to
empathize
the
white
woman
in
Spokane
who
pass
herself
off
as
black
with
a
local
chapter
of
the
NAACP
I
identify
as
black
she
say
I
be
like
there
be
no
way
this
be
real
this
story
be
not
real
they
get
a
woman
to
pose
for
these
picture
this
be
crazy
best
way
to
cool
everyone
off
or
worst
depend
on
how
you
see
it
the
crush
snowfall
that
hammer
the
Northeast
it
be
the
winter
that
never
end
every
time
we
turn
around
Poor
Boston
it
keep
on
snow
and
snow
and
snow
my
sister
roof
leak

mother

frozen

I
think

still
have
not
clear
off
last
year
snow
this
year
bad
weather
in
the
form
of
hurricane
typhoon
and
drought

that
look
more
like

no

slam

harder
than
Donald

he
accelerate
into

pronouncement
about

bring
drug

he
meet
every
challenger
head
on
even
as
pundit
predict
time
and
again
he
could
not
last
get
out

here
so
Donald
Trump
have
prove
those
of
we
who
think
we
know
something
about
politics
wrong
every
step
of
the
way
I
think
that
we
be
now
only
begin
to
appreciate
the
anger
and
the
passion
among
the
electorate
which
be
something
that
trump
have
be
able
to
tap
into
meanwhile
fact
checkers

comedian
go
wild
this
be
the
year
where
the
Saturday
night
live
skit
be
write
themselves
when
it
come
to
the
politics
they
write
themselves
they
do
not
have
my
talent
my
money
or
especially
my
good
look
unfortunately
the
way
we
elect
we
president
be
not
unlike
the
way
we
create
hit
tv
show
with
a
crowded
republican
field
some
voter
be
unimpressed
I
do
not
care
who
be
polling
better
right
now
we
have
many
month
to
go
it
be
go
to
be
a
very
long
process
I
will
tell
you
I
be
go
to
do
a
lot
of
research
before
that
happen
but
I
have
not
even
begin
there
be
just
too
many
people
in
the
playing
field
on
the
democratic
side
Hillary
Clinton
come
in
as
the
front-runner
and
stay
there
thank
you
so
much
even
though
some
in
she
party
rally
around
she
few
challenger
let
make
it
seem
like
we
have
a
lot
of
viable
people
but
the
former
secretary
of
state
still
have
problem
the
only
other
thing
I
can
really
think
of
be
Clinton
Benghazi
amid
persistent
question
about
the
Benghazi
attack
come
the
revelation
that
as
secretary
of
state
she
use
a
private
e-mail
server
in
she
home
to
conduct
government
business
she
try
to
laugh
it
off
hey
do
you
wipe
the
server
what
like
with
a
cloth
or
something
even
as
she
insist
she
do
nothing
wrong
poll
reveal
as
many
as
60
%
of
voter
do
not
trust
she
part
of
be
a
Clinton
it
seem
be
accept
that
there
be
people
out
there
who
will
never
trust
you
and
might
never
like
you
but
still
be
able
to
or
try
to
get
51
%
of
the
vote
strangely
enough
she
best
defense
come
from
a
challenger
Vermont
Bernie
Sanders
the
american

be
sick
and
tired
of

process
and
just
plain
angry
the
biggest
trend

outsider
status
Hillary

I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
lady
Chris
Christie
be
like
well
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
republican
in
a
democratic
state
one
always
hesitate
to
criticize
or
to
comment
in
a
sense
on
a
political
process
when
the
people
be
be
give
the
right
to
speak
but
this
be
extraordinary
I
do
not
even
know
how
many
people
be
run
for
president
be
it
like
eight
I
have
no
idea
the
good
part
be
you

people
who
have
never
care
about

in
they
life
that
actually
be
watch

be
talk
about

be
trend
as
the
kid
say
trend
least
effective
way
to
get
yourself
hear
in
Washington
because
you
might
just
be
shoot
down
fly
a
gyrocopter
to
the
Capitol
in
a
call
for
campaign
finance
reform
most
effective
way
to
get
hear
black
life
matter
the
group
confront
politician
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
scoring
headline
every
time
some

matter
by
and
large
have
be
the
most
peaceful
protest
when
compare
to
some
of
these
other
movement
if
you
catch
my
drift
worst
job
of
convincing
voter
they
be
listen
to
anyone
the
Congress
I
think
Congress
be
Darth
vader
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
Congress
can
do
to
make
itself
more
likeable
whether
it
be
a
democratic
congress
or
a
republican
Congress
it
be
just
one
of
those
word
that
Americans
seem
to
think
you

fingernail
on
a

keep
ask

what
would
my
crime
to

force
out

why
be
I
a
refugee
I
speak
on
behalf
of
four
million
syrian
refugee
now
scatter
all
over
the

I
be
lucky
I
have
a
shelter
and
I
go
to
university
but
there
be
many
strand
on
the
border
with
no
shelter
and
nothing
to
eat
why
do
we
have
to
pay
the
price
a
sentiment
echo
by
those
still
in
Syria
and
those
who
risk
they
life
to
find
refuge
abroad
and
they
all
feel
betray
by
the
world
diplomacy
can
bring
refugee
to
return
home
and
a
great
thing
and
that
will
largely
depend
if
president
Assad
and
opposition
be
ready
for
some
sort
of
compromise
Al

on
Turkey

Syria
ongoing

we
visit
the

for
internally
displaced
people
outside
of
irbill
in
northern
Iraq
and
speak
to
unicef
with
challenge
face
by
such
people
in
need
at
this
camp
it
have
be
rain
since
last
night
it
be
extremely
tough
condition
for
these
people
when
I
try
to
walk
here
these
street
be
now
just
mud
we
just
see
in
these
pool
in
this
makeshift
playground
that
be
be
make
by
the
government
and
the
refugee
agency
these
pool
child
be
play
in
these
cold
condition
and
have
nothing
else
to
do
these
parent
and
child
be
go
through
one
of
the
toughest
time
in
they
livelihood
and
we
be
talk
to
a
family
who
have
a
five-year-old
and
they
be
tell
we
all
they
child
have
see
be
this
camp
let
I
speak
to
the
United
nation
child
agency
who
join
we
now
and
Jeffrey
welcome
so
tell
we
put
this
into
perspective
we
have
be
see
number
in
term
of
million
of
people
be
not
it
a
bit
overwhelming
and
put
this
into
perspective
for
we
what
we
have
right
now
in
Iraq
be
three
million
people
internally
displace
and
nearly
10
million
people
that
need
humanitarian
assistance
what
this
mean
be
that
one
out
of
every
five
child
in
Iraq
have
be
displaced
or
have
they
education
disrupt
or
somehow
be
effect
by
this
crisis
these
number
be
hard
to
grapple
with
and
be
so
huge
and
large
that
just
look
at
they
over
the
year
it
be
a
immense
difficulty
deal
with
it
and
you
can
see
the
condition
which
people
be
live
and
the
camp
offer
refuge
but
only
10
%
of
the
people
displace
can
come
to
the
camp
and
90
%
of
they
be
live
in
host
community
unfinished
building
with
family
who
have
take
they
in
and
they
access
to
education
access
to
service
access
to
basic
life
be
limit
also
Jeffrey
can
you
tell
we
we
be
earlier
discuss
about
the
prospects
for
some
of
these
child
and
there
be
more
than
million
child
just
in
Iraq
alone
and
if
the
world
community
do
not
act
what
be
the
future
for
they
the
child
of
Iraq
right
now
the
one
whose
have
be
affect
which
be
as
you
say
a
very
large
number
be
face
a
very
grim
future
if
they
do
not
get
access
to
education
if
they
parent
do
not
get
access
to
lively
hood
and
do
not
get
the
training
they
need
to
be
productive
adult
they
will
not
have
much
of
a
future
and
people
of
the
camp
be
feel
frustrated
and
a
lot
of
the
people
in
the
camp
have
be
here
over
a
year
and
do
not
see
any
future
in
site
so
that
be
why
they
be
fly
Iraq
and
go
to
place
in
Europe
and
seek
refuge
and
take
terrible
risk
because
they
do
not
see
how
they
will
maintain
this
type
of
lifestyle
here
talk
to
we
about
the
challenge
that
be
face
by
not
just
the
government
but
other
agency
as
well
there
be
a
lack
of
fund
and
you
be
tell
I
a
lack
of
commitment
we
be
look
at
right
now
if
we
want
to
fund
the
entire
program
just
the
bare
bone
and
u
UNICEF
need
million
with
just
clothing
and
we
give
to
1900
child
in
this
camp
alone
and
aim
to
provide
blanket
and
clothing
to
over
child
and
in
this
wintertime
where
we
have
child
walk
around
bare
foot
these
be
the
worry
now
get
through
the
next
month
and
beyond
that
try
and
provide
education
try
and
provide
medical
service
and
livelihood
and
resilience
for

you
request
I
to
lead
the
country
again
after

give
the
importance
you
attach
to
this
I
can
only
accept
what
remains
be
to
follow
normal
law
and
procedure
when
the
time
come
but
I
do
not
think
we
aim
be
to
have
a
president
for
life
nor
be
it
what
I
would
want
sooner
rather
than
later
this
office
will
be
transfer
from
one
person
to
another
in
a
manner
that
will
serve
a
purpose
not
merely
set
a

whether
for

for
other
Iran

Marvin

and
believe
Iran
be
justify
in
he
reaction
to
what
he
call
aggression
I
think
the
belief
in
Tehran
be
that
what
the
Americans
be
try
to
do
be
after
the
agreement
between
Iran
and
the
p
five
plus
one
they
be
look
for
new
way
to
impose
the
sanction
regime
so
that
they
could
compensate
for
any
concession
that
have
be
give
to
Iran
and
we
see
a
pattern
the
Americans
have
be
confiscatee
iranian
asset
Iranians
consider
that
to
be
theft
and
they
have
be
restrict
visa
application
for
Iranians
who
have
dual
nationality
as
well
as
anyone
who
travel
or
who
have
travel
to
Iran
over
the
past
five
year
so
Iranians
believe
the
Americans
be
not
be
sincere
the
United
States
say
one
thing
but
do
something
else
iranian
defense
capability

a

result
of

I
be
out

it
however

what
do
you
say
to
people
look
in
say
what
be
on
my
first
concern
be
in
each
agency
that
you
describe
view
the
University
of
Phoenix
there
be
a
predisposition
that
there
be
malfeasance
in
the

what
concern
I
be
this
really
be
government
by
Fiat
be
not
it
how
so
we
have
interagency
task
force
we
have
proclamation
make
we
be
paint
with
this
broad
brush
that
we
be
all
guilty
of
grotesque
sin
and
where
be
the
evidence
that
would
throw
we
into
the
category
be
you
say
all
the
federal
agency
be
wrong
I
be
say
to
the
contrary
that
be
they
job
they
job
be
to
go
forward
and
say
give
we
datum
on
no
matter
who
be
wrong
the
question
remain
whether
the
government
be
do
enough
to
make
sure
veteran
have
the
fact
about
to-profit
college
Mary
snow
show
you
how
little
be
do
to
warn
vet
about
the
school
and
who
be
to
blame

later
how

look
I
be
talk

by

several
time
a
day

anything

include
some

who
say
the

last
three
year
and
be
the
federal

enough
to

I
do
not
think
so
this
have
become
-
it
be
not
a
bipartisan
issue
it
be
very
partisan
at
the
heart
of
the
controversy
be
a
rule
that

not
receive
half
they
money
from

the
money
from
the

fall
into
the
10
%
category
and

they
be
try

that
they
say
that
the

be
a
reason
why
for-profit

have
work
with

to
propose

this

a
senator
speak
out
in

of
the

be
John

be
a
for-profit
stealth
attack
orchestrate
and
carry
out
by
the
senator
from
Illinois
who
have
a
well-known
record
of
not
support
the

Senator
McCain
decline
interview
but
in
a
passionate
speech
he
want
the
department
of
defense
probation
lift
and
accuse
the
Obama
administration
of
launch
a
smear
campaign
the

Krishna
a
Navy
veteran
graduate
with
a

she
have
a
terrific

worry
the

other
she
join
I
from
San
Diego
thank
you

be
with

how
do
you
square
you
own
positive
experience
with
University

with
the
long
list
of
allegation
and
investigatese
into
the
school
--
investigation
into
the
school
I
try
to
look
at
to
this
way
I
work
really
hard
for
my
degree
so
do
everyone
in
class
that
be
with
I
we
work

spend

programme

a

of
value
in
offer
you
be
not

the
the

be
here

raise
concern
about

a
degree
from
a
for-profit
college
or
the
University
of
Phoenix
do
they
hold
some
responsibility
you
do
not
like
the
media
intensity
but
it
seem
they
have
do
a
few
thing
that
deserve
it
the
way
I
look
into
it
with
the
recruiting
practice
and
I
do
not
believe
that
any
school
out
there
should
have
a
you
know
direct
line
to
veteran
or
recruiter
or
group
of
student
and
I
do
not
doctoring
with
the
government
step
in
regulate
that
to
take
it
a
step
further
and
turn
it
into
a
political
value
that
would
hurt
veteran
more
disservice

have
you
with
we
today
okay
Anna
start
with
you
look
into
you
crystal
ball
what
be
about
to
happen
now
oh
Lord
Alyson
that
crystal
ball
be
so
--
so
hard
to
read
in
to2015
I
be
not
sure
I
will
do
a
better
job
of
it
in
2016
but
you
be
right
we
be
in
a
sprint
contribution
I
be
very
happy
to
tell
you
we
have
about
two
more
week
of
mindless
speculation
leave
oh
good
you
do
know
that
--
Iowa
voter
New
Hampshire
voter
these
folk
just
take
they
time
they
like
to
look
under
the
hood
and
a
lot
of
they
half
of
they
do
not
make
up
they
mind
until
that
last
week
but
certainly
we
be
in
the
sprint
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
a
lot
of
candidate
spend
a
lot
of
time
some
of
they
focus
on
Iowa
some
more
focus
in
New
Hampshire
too
reasonable
bite
off
some
stuff
and
chew
on
it
oh
good
Jeffrey
Lorde
the
prop
Sills
tell
I
why
it
be
true
or
false
in
the
new
year
Trump
can
not
hold
on
in
Iowa
the
evangelical
base
too
big
they
do
not
like
the
negativity
they
go
Cruz
true
or
false
and
why
sure
possible
sure
absolutely
possible
what
be
all
the
hedge
Jeffrey
come
on
it
be
2016
take
a
risk
be
you
ask
I
could
Ted
Cruz
win
this
in
Iowa
yes
the
question
be
what
can
he
do
beyond
that
and
the
one
thing
that
I
would
add
be
--
Ronald
Reagan
of
course
lose
Iowa
and
become
president
Rick
Santorum
and
Governor
Huckabee
both
win
Iowa
and
never
become
Iowa
so
win
Iowa
in
and
of
itself
do
not
do
anything
I
really
do
think
this
be
go
to
be
a
long
march
here
a
long
March
New
Hampshire
South
Carolina
Nevada
be
and
on
beyond
that
so
whoever
win
even
if
Donald
Trump
win
Iowa
that
be
not
go
to
solve
anything
Amanda
or
settle
anything
Amanda
win
Iowa
do
not
mean
anything
it
be
always
good
to
win
Iowa
but
here
be
the
thing
Iowa
do
not
crown
a
king
but
it
knock
out
a
lot
of
princes
I
think
we
be
go
to
see
a
lot
of
candidate
--
remember
how
big
this
field
be
they
be
go
to
get
knock
out
and
then
another
big
shake-up
when
the
poll
be
redistribute
think
about
it
the
guy
in
the
undercard
debate
may
have
just
1
%
or
20
pe
%
in
t
poll
but
that
could
mean
a
lot
after
Iowa
a
big
shake-up
good
to
win
but
win
Iowa
be
not
everything
can
not
trust
the
other
two
with
this
next
one
stay
with
you
Great
after
what
we
see
with
trump
and
JEB
where
trump
--
I
know
you
be
sick
of
it
but
say
it
again
trump
look
at
Jeb
and
say
who
be
talk
I
or
you
Jeb
I
or
you
and
she
give
a
little
of
that
action
which
be
what
Jeb
Bush
say
and
I
say
this
be
a
new
Jeb
Bush
who
decide
to
be
the
anti-trump
and
it
be
go
to
give
he
a
boost
yes
or
no
Amanda
yeah
I
mean
it
be
always
good
to
see
JEB
assert
himself
on
the
national
stage
I
think
a
lot
of
people
be
wait
to
see
real
personality
come
out
and
the
less
guard
Jeb
Bush
be
the
better
it
be
for
he
that
say
I
still
think
it
be
a
bad
idea
for
Jeb
Bush
to
define
he
candidacy
via
trump
be
he
own
man
quick
look
back
on
he
Florida
run
try
to
run
with
that
and
get
in
the
middle
of
that
Anna
you
be
close
of
course
to
Jeb
Bush
be
that
the
moment
in
the
last
CNN
debate
where
he
find
he
sea
leg
do
he
feel
he
find
he
voice
that
night
you
know
I
be
see
a
different
Jeb
Bush
in
the
last
several
week
I
think
that
really
since
what
seem
like
ancient
history
but
since
the
very
bad
debate
in
boulder
I
think
he
figure
out
theatric
be
part
of
the
job
description
and
be
now
do
it
I
also
see
he
do
much
more
focus
on
New
Hampshire
which
I
think
be
smart
as
we
have
discuss
Iowa
mean
something
it
do
not
mean
everything
the
only
time
Iowa
mean
something
huge
be
when
it
be
a
upset
like
in
2008
when
Barack
Obama
upset
then
Hillary
Clinton
if
we
see
that
on
either
the
republican
or
Democrat
side
it
would
be
huge
on
Jeb
I
think
you
will
see
he
keep
grind
away
a
lot
of
retail
politics
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
early
state
New
Hampshire
and
South
Carolina
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
he
try
to
do
this
the
old-fashioned
way
one
voter
at
a
time
Amanda
do
you
want
to
jump
in
yeah
one
thing
about
that
the
interesting
part
of
the
new
JEB
dynamic
be
that
a
rise
JEB
a
rise
Chris
Christie
make
life
a
lot
harder
for
Marco
Rubio
in
many
way
they
be
compete
for
the
same
type
of
voter
the
more
they
clash
the
more
those
three
continue
to
be
competitive
with
each
other
mark
it
easier
for
a
Cruz
or
trump
to
take
the
bigger
lane
actually
I
think
the
two
young
buck
have
be
lock
horn
and
we
be
go
to
could
not
see
Cruz
and
Rubio
who
be
so
evenly
match
both
rookie
senator
who
be
you
know
both
lawyer
very
different
style
one
go
poetic
the
other
go
legalese
on
we
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
the
two
of
they
clash
a
lot
which
I
be
not
sure
do
not
open
up
a
space
for
another
candidate
maybe
Jefferies
maybe
somebody
else
Jeffrey
what
about
this
one
the
chance
that
Donald
Trump
pick
a
female
running
mate
before
the
convention
before
the
convention
yes
possible
yeah
sure
I
can
see
it
possible
it
be
possible
that
Alyson
knock
I
unconscious
in
the
next
15
seconds
probable
you
know
so
I
think
sure
absolutely
absolutely
I
mean
if
Donald
Trump
win
this
nomination
or
it
become
certain
ahead
of
time
that
he
be
go
to
do
it
yeah
yes
that
be
possible
he
could
pick
Carly
Fiorina
oh
come
on
Jeffrey
he
can
not
stand
Carly
Fiorina
he
have
say
over
and
over
again
five
minute
of
hear
she
voice
be
you
know
--
but
Carly
hold
she
own
in
the
debate
wait
wait
wait
wait
wait
could
not
stand
Lyndon
Johnson
but
make
he
vice
presidet
Donald
Trump
be
no
jfk
one
other
thing
here
I
really
think
this
be
go
to
be
the
year
of
the
outsider
again
and
I
mean
election
year
itself
so
whether
it
be
Donald
Trump
or
ted
Cruz
or
whom
ever
I
think
the
outside
be
win
I
think
that
be
why
Donald
Trump
pick
on
Jeb
Bush
all
the
tile
not
because
he
think
Jeb
Bush
be
a
threat
but
because
Jeb
Bush
be
the
very
symbol
of
the
establishment
and
whether
it
be
Jeb
Bush
or
John
Kasich
or
other
I
think
that
be
a
real
weak
inside
and
somebody
on
the
outside
be
go
to
win
this
nomination
I
think
we
be
go
to
leave
it
there
absolutely
Jeffrey
--
happy
new
year
thank
you
guy
thank
you
Amanda
and
Anna
great
to
see
you
-lsb-
speak
in
foreign
language
-rsb-
thank
you
Mick
the
evolve
threat
from
Isis
grow
deadlier
downing
a
passenger
plane
over
Egypt
and
carry
attack
in
Egypt
inspiring
the
first
deadly
attack
here
at
home
how
will
world
leader
combat
Isis
we
will
discuss
that
ahead
I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you
doctor
if
it
be
right
for
you
when
heartburn
hit
fight
back
fast
tum
smoothie
start
dissolve
the
instant
it
touch
you
tongue
and
neutralize
stomach
acid
at
the
source
tum
tum
tum
tum

only
from

now
in
2015
the
number
of
refugee
flee
war-torn
country
like
Syria
reach
the
level
of
a
international
crisis
thousand
have
die
make
dangerous
journey
to
escape
turmoil
at
home
million
more
nowhere
to
go
there
will
be
a
solution
what
be
go
to
happen
in
Syria
what
be
go
to
happen
with
daesh
what
will
the
new
year
bring
let
talk
a
CNN
global
affair
analyst
and
of
course
happy
new
year
to
you
and
wish
you
all
the
best
always
so
let
take
a
look
into
the
ball
we
have
■
annreasonable
expect
apg
of
speed
when
it
come
to
deal
with
terror
deal
with
daesh
isil
or
Isis
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
how
do
you
see
progress
in
this
year
you
have
to
color
I
skeptical
I
think
that
it
be
good
thing
that
there
be
more
negotiation
take
place
that
all
of
the
different
foreign
player
be
try
to
push
Assad
and
the
rebel
into
some
kind
of
a
negotiate
settlement
but
I
be
not
very
optimistic
that
that
be
go
to
go
very
far
the
problem
be
that
all
the
outer
outside
player
whether
Russia
Iran
the
United
States
Saudi
Arabia
and
so
on
none
of
these
country
seem
to
agree
on
the
basics
who
be
the
bad
guy
different
people
have
different
idea
of
who
the
bad
guy
who
be
the
good
guy
therefore
can
Assad
stay
can
there
be
a
solution
with
Assad
some
say
yes
some
say
never
so
because
these
other
group
can
not
arrive
at
a
common
idea
of
what
progress
look
like
any
negotiation
towards
progress
I
do
not
think
will
go
very
far
it
be
a
good
thing
they
be
talk
always
better
to
talk
than
to
shoot
but
the
problem
be
that
unless
you
have
a
real
framework
conversation
be
not
go
to
go
anywhere
you
see
a
massive
deployment
of
troops
on
the
ground
I
do
not
see
that
happen
unless
absent
a
major
event
in
the
United
States
I
think
public
opinion
in
the
United
States
will
remain
strongly
oppose
to
put
boot
on
the
ground
and
no
american
president
especially
not
a
lame
duck
one
let
not
forget
be
go
to
be
able
to
persuade
the
american
people
that
we
need
to
put
american
boot
on
the
ground
so
absent
hope
that
never
happen
absent
a
major
terrorist
attack
against
a
american
target
I
do
not
see
bill
number
of
american
soldier
go
2016
take
on
Islam
within
its
own
faith
the
battle
for
the
soul
of
Islam
will
we
see
the
muslim
community
come
on
the
state
level
and
on
the
popular
level
against
the
enemy
I
argue
that
be
already
go
on
it
will
continue
to
gain
steam
I
think
there
be
conversation
take
place
among
islamic
scholar
how
to
deal
with
this
I
be
in
Iran
earlier
this
month
earlier
last
month
and
there
be
a
lot
of
conversation
take
place
there
the
islamic
community
be
already
grapple
with
this
I
do
not
think
they
need
a
major
event
or
a
major
calendar
event
to
take
place
for
they
to
accelerate
I
think
that
be
take
place
already
you
do
not
have
massive
army
say
of
Saudi
Arabia
go
either
way
on
that
but
Turkey
you
do
not
have
they
say
this
be
we
fight
yes
help
we
give
we
money
planning
Intel
but
this
be
we
nobody
go
to
tell
we
what
be
muslim
be
we
will
take
it
be
you
do
not
see
that
and
many
say
that
be
what
should
be
happen
I
do
not
think
that
be
a
realistic
expectation
because
the
enemy
be
not
a
traditional
nation
state
even
though
Isis
control
territory
it
be
not
as
if
a
muslim
country
can
say
we
be
go
to
go
and
send
we
troops
there
and
fight
those
people
these
guy
be
everywhere
Turkey
be
deal
you
mention
Turkey
they
be
deal
with
extremism
within
they
own
country
Isis
be
already
you
know
--
there
be
be
landfall
in
Turkey
event
of
killing
within
Turkey
this
be
a
struggle
within
not
a
struggle
without
so
much
and
that
struggle
be
already
take
place
I
would
pay
less
attention
to
political
leader
in
the
muslim
world
and
more
attention
to
--
to
civil
group
I
mean
sort
of
activist
religious
figure
and
I
think
if
you
focus
you
attention
there
you
will
see
there
be
a
lot
of
struggle
already
go
on
about
how
to
deal
with
extremism
alarmist
politician
have
different
agenda
to
deal
with
and
sometimes
they
be
contradictory
to
what
we
would
like
they
to
be
do
but
in
--
in
ordinary
civil
society
there
be
a
lot
take
place
that
be
room
for
optimism
a
lot
of
time
before
we
be
go
to
see
real
change
on
the
ground
and
all
about
how
we
spin
it
any
look
from
Bobby
Ghosh
in
2016
any
chance
grow
out
the
hair
I
know
you
have
a
big
head
of
hair
at
some
point
a
long
time
ago
not
go
back
to
that
the
world
do
not
need
to
see
that
trust
I
a
successful
look
trust
I
Alisyn

congratulation
feel
good
all
eye
on
the
presidential
race
but
there
be
plenty
of
key
congressional
race
to
watch
as
well
how
will
donald
trump
rise
affect
the
republican
reign
in
both
house
of
Congress
here
to
illustrate
it
all
with
a
magic
wall
CNN
chief
national
correspondent
John
King
happy
new
year
I
be
go
to
take
a
vacation
can
I
have
the
year
off
no
a
busy
year
for
you
okay
let
start
right
now
what
do
you
predict
the
trump
effect
will
be
not
obviously
just
on
the
presidential
race
this
year
but
on
all
other
congressional
race
a
easier
question
to
answer
in
March
or
April
when
we
know
more
about
the
outcome
of
the
presidential
primary
no
question
head
into
the
new
year
republican
be
worry
Democrats
happy
you
already
hear
Hillary
Clinton
and
Bernie
Sanders
on
the
campaign
trail
say
all
republican
be
anti-muslim
and
anti-african-american
anti-immigrant
and
anti-hispanic
they
be
try
to
paint
the
Republican
party
with
the
trump
brush
if
you
will
and
the
Republican
establishment
be
clearly
worry
about
it
they
be
worry
that
some
race
that
be
probably
lean
republican
now
a
Senate
map
we
can
go
through
they
worry
some
of
the
race
lean
Republican
could
go
democratic
if
trump
stay
in
the
headline
the
nominee
even
more
worried
it
be
a
factor
how
big
ask
I
in
March
April
May
a
little
bit
of
what
be
go
on
though
be
in-house
disorder
right
the
GOP
have
make
big
gain
since
Obama
have
be
the
president
of
the
United
States
and
maybe
there
be
a
feeling
within
the
party
that
they
do
not
get
what
they
be
bargaining
for
in
term
of
you
know
this
big
movement
of
blue
to
red
across
that
map
that
you
can
show
we
and
yet
feel
they
do
not
have
anything
to
show
for
that
so
they
be
angry
at
they
own
party
can
we
see
that
exactly
right
Chris
and
why
the
republican
base
be
so
upset
a
Senate
map
back
to
Senate
race
in
a
minute
take
you
to
the
House
map
look
at
all
the
red
the
United
States
of
America
247
House
district
control
by
republican
a
lot
of
red
a
big
majority
Republican
remember
this
back
to
right
after
president
Obama
be
elect
all
the
blue
Democrats
have
the
majority
257
this
be
after
the
election
in
2008
right
the
2010
mid-term
huge
republican
gain
get
majority
2012
Democrats
get
a
little
back
they
win
eight
seat
in
2012
not
a
big
presidential
sweep
in
the
second
term
only
eight
seat
for
democrat
then
2014
wow
boom
look
at
this
a
lot
of
people
on
the
coast
which
be
blue
tend
to
forget
this
America
be
very
red
the
republican
base
be
upset
have
a
house
majority
win
the
Senate
majority
in
midterm
last
time
31
governorship
and
do
not
think
they
be
get
conservative
leadership
part
because
you
have
a
Democrat
in
the
White
House
but
why
you
have
trump
and
other
talk
to
the
republican
base
say
why
do
we
keep
win
but
not
get
what
we
want
a
big
part
of
the
dynamic
John
what
happen
with
that
calculation
if
Donald
Trump
run
as
a
third-party
candidate
as
he
sometimes
threaten
to
to
what
would
be
he
signature
animal
if
you
look
at
the
datum
Donald
Trump
be
a
third-party
candidate
the
datum
today
as
we
enter
the
year
and
again
if
we
learn
anything
in
2015
to
remember
in
2016
be
thing
change
and
we
live
in
a
volatile
environment
look
at
the
date
Taye
today
Donald
trump
be
a
third-party
candidate
hurt
the
Republican
Party
and
you
can
almost
guarantee
a
democratic
victory
almost
how
do
that
play
out
people
come
out
to
vote
for
trump
as
a
independent
they
be
still
vote
for
House
and
Senate
and
choice
be
d
or
you
would
assume
most
be
republicans
nap
be
a
potential
wild
card
especially
when
it
come
to
turnout
operation
Republicans
try
to
turn
out
vote
for
president
in
a
state
also
vote
for
Senate
but
the
trump
factor
there
become
pretty
strange
what
do
you
get
what
be
go
to
be
he
petronous
curse
he
party
animal
I
get
it
the
Teddy

what
do
you
say
John

well
he
be
the

how
do
you
attach
a

to
that
he
be

kind
of

I
be
go

rather
ra
what
we
want
to
do
we
often
say
lower
credit
card
debt
and
spend
less
money
but
there
be
more
involved
thing
we
can
be
aware
of
and
you
be
go
to
walk
we
through
some
of
the
resolution
we
need
to
be
make
absolutely
it
be
a
new
year
I
always
say
new
year
and
you
birthday
the
two
time
you
really
look
at
you
money
twice
a
year
new
year
and
you
birthday
and
I
need
to
buy
myself
a
nice
something
for
my
birthday
talk
about
mortgage
rate
what
do
predict
be
go
to
happen
for
those
think
of
buy
a
home
refiing
any
of
that
you
will
hear
about
how
mortgage
and
interest
rate
be
rise
true
but
mortgage
rate
will
rise
slowly
and
well
below
the
historical
average
for
post-world
war
ii
you
want
to
buy
a
home
a
nice
time
to
buy
a
home
rate
be
low
refinance
the
biggest
money-saving
thing
you
do
all
year
if
you
refinance
you
loan
absolutely
many
have
already
do
that
a
couple
of
time
hello
you
know
$
400
save
per
month
and
that
be
something
we
should
think
about
too
there
be
go
to
be
more
market
volatility
save
will
be
important
this
year
right
because
of
that
volatility
we
see
last
year
so
many
of
we
we
will
talk
about
that
in
a
minute
be
a
little
shy
and
we
be
look
at
we
personal
finances
in
a
little
different
way
which
bring
I
to
gas
price
we
have
see
some
low
do
you
think
that
be
go
to
extend
into
this
new
year
gas
price
stay
pretty
low
they
do
and
you
really
need
to
look
at
that
money
not
as
money
fall
out
of
you
pocket
into
something
else
important
to
take
the
savings
build
you
cash
reserve
make
sure
you
have
three
to
six
month
of
money
on
hand
liquid
money
on
hand
for
a
emergency
and
really
take
a
look
at
use
that
little
bit
extra
in
you
monthly
budget
to
pay
down
high
interest
credit
card
debt
get
out
of
debt
and
start
save
move
forward
important
to
get
out
of
debt
before
interest
rate
rise
then
the
cost
of
debt
become
higher
gas
will
stay
low
I
agree
oil
around
$
50
a
barrel
because
OPEC
be
continue
to
pump
a
lot
iranian
as
sanction
g
away
and
still
have
shale
here
at
home
and
that
do
not
mean
great
news
for
the
energy
sector
it
do
not
and
not
for
investor
you
keep
hear
volatility
in
stock
market
concern
be
global
demand
weak
raise
interest
rate
the
rest
of
the
world
low
interest
rate
some
country
negative
what
do
that
mean
for
investor
you
should
not
expect
big
stock
market
gain
I
do
not
think
anybody
be
forecast
that
in
you
stock
market
portfolio
incredibly
important
to
be
dollar
cost
averaging
buy
stock
every
month
periodically
make
sure
you
know
what
you
mix
be
for
you
risk
and
how
long
you
have
until
you
retire
and
be
put
money
away
into
a
529
for
you
kid
college
tuition
go
up
invest
for
you
child
education
too
important
to
remember
too
even
though
the
market
be
not
go
up
blue
chip
stock
be
a
great
place
to
be
jut
because
we
will
not
get
the
return
maybe
from
the
past
we
be
the
pretty
house
on
the
ugly
block
that
be
the
global
economy
the
rest
of
the
world
be
not
do
as
well
in
many
case
as
the
since
we
have
the
time
to
ask
you
this
look
forward
there
be
probably
a
couple
people
just
start
out
right
start
out
thinking
I
be
hear
my
parent
tell
I
in
my
ear
get
into
the
market
I
want
to
start
it
be
very
overwhelming
what
be
the
best
piece
of
advice
to
tell
somebody
the
new
year
have
come
this
be
the
year
to
do
it
dip
my
baby
toe
into
the
stock
market
absolutely
do
it
it
be
terrifying
you
see
the
volatility
take
the
long
view
you
be
a
young
person
and
be
in
the
market
there
be
room
for
change
and
there
be
go
to
be
volatility
this
year
no
question
you
do
not
sell
when
the
market
go
down
remember
that
Hang
tight
everybody
panic
it
be
we
psychology
but
you
get
to
hang
tight
weather
the
storm
and
you
will
end
up
better
in
stock
two
kind
of
people
in
the
world
the
kind
who
think
about
how
they
be
spend
they
money
and
the
kind
that
think
how
to
grow
they
money
you
want
to
be
the
person
grow
you
money
make
sure
you
be
live
on
a
little
less
than
you
bring
home
every
month
and
the
rest
investing
and
do
that
in
the
stock
market
you
do
that
with
investment
and
I
think
52
%
of
american
household
have
stock
they
have
be
over
the
past
six
year
able
to
grow
they
household
net
worth
because
wages
be
not
do
it
not
get
higher
wages
it
be
through
the
stock
market
I
do
not
think
the
stock
market
will
be
gang
buster
but
you
need
to
be
in
it
for
those
that
can
and
give
the
volatility
and
some
sector
will
feel
they
own
the
emergency
fund
something
you
have
teach
I
a
lot
about
have
that
extra
cushion
sure
how
--
what
be
the
best
way
to
start
a
emergency
fund
for
yourself
it
have
to
be
automatic
take
it
of
you
0
you
paycheck
almost
not
see
that
money
it
be
so
important
half
of
all
american
can
not
put
they
hand
on
even
$
if
they
need
to
in
a
emergency
you
have
to
have
the
saving
a
lot
of
people
be
one
flat
tire
away
from
ruin
they
household
budget
and
be
in
debt
on
household
credit
get
out
of
the
credit
card
debt
it
be
the
worst
thing
and
get
out
of
debt
for
young
people
with
student
loan
ten
year
pay
it
off
in
ten
year
a
lot
of
kid
be
try
to
get
out
of
it
from
under
in
five
they
want
to
be
part
of
the
middle
class
and
want
to
invest
not
pay
down
a
student
loan
we
give
you
a
lot
of
information
seem
overwhelming
the
great
thing
you
be
here
for
we
all
year
long
we
can
turn
to
you
when
we
have
question
what
be
go
on
out
there
what
we
can
do
thank
you
so
much
for
the
new
year
resolution
for
we
financial
health
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
to
you
as
well
speaking
of
resolution
president
Obama
have
one
a
top
priority
for
2016
of
course
he
final
year
in
office
talk
about
gun
control
will
there
really
finally
be
change
in
Washington
the
country
be
still
reel
from
the
terror
attack
in
San
Bernardino
last
month
how
do
lawmaker
plan
to
tackle
that
in
the
new
year
here
to
discuss
a
commentator
and
conservative
radio
host
Ben
Ferguson
happy
new
year
to
both
of
you
gentleman
a
interesting
pairing
on
this
topic
because
let
start
with
the
common
ground
you
actually
come
from
similar
position
in
term
of
you
family
use
gun
you
be
from
hunting
family
you
both
know
how
to
use
gun
you
shoot
gun
yet
you
be
on
different
side
of
the
gun
control
issue
Charles
start
with
you
what
do
you
think
lawmaker
plan
to
do
about
gun
control
in
the
coming
year
I
do
not
think
they
be
necessarily
be
a
plan
and
I
do
not
think
there
be
necessarily
go
to
be
a
lot
of
progress
right
because
what
end
up
happen
be
that
this
debate
run
up
against
kind
of
constitutional
structure
of
the
country
the
gun
ownership
and
the
gun
debate
overlap
quite
significantly
with
the
kind
of
wide
open
space
in
this
country
and
people
who
want
more
regulation
be
generally
in
the
cluster
urban
space
but
because
of
the
way
the
Senate
be
structure
every
state
no
matter
how
wide
open
how
few
people
be
in
that
state
still
have
two
senator
right
you
have
--
you
know
Brooklyn
have
more
population
than
all
of
Alaska
but
New
York
state
be
only
go
to
have
two
senator
just
like
Alaska
have
two
senator
so
when
you
get
down
to
vote
on
a
actual
kind
of
more
regulation
the
people
in
Alaska
who
be
more
hunting
culture
be
go
to
say
those
senator
say
my
constituent
do
not
necessarily
want
this
and
I
be
not
go
to
necessarily
support
this
what
be
make
it
such
a
challenge
in
Congress
to
see
any
sort
of
action
but
then
president
Obama
say
after
the
tragedy
in
Newtown
he
would
do
whatever
he
could
sound
like
he
be
eye
some
executive
action
on
gun
control
yeah
I
think
you
will
see
a
awful
lot
of
executive
action
especially
the
closer
we
get
to
the
end
of
he
presidency
this
be
something
he
want
to
be
a
part
of
he
legacy
if
they
really
want
to
get
something
do
on
Capitol
Hill
start
new
year
off
on
the
right
foot
there
be
thing
Charles
and
I
and
other
can
agree
on
that
be
probably
take
smaller
step
to
deal
with
specific
issue
one
would
be
mental
health
there
be
I
think
bipartisan
support
find
on
deal
with
mental
health
and
what
we
should
do
when
it
come
to
buy
a
gun
or
if
commit
by
a
state
or
by
a
judge
those
be
the
type
of
thing
Congress
could
have
success
on
try
to
turn
it
into
a
massive
gun
control
law
it
will
not
pass
there
be
not
the
vote
there
as
Charles
talk
about
you
have
leadership
focus
on
simple
issue
to
find
the
common
ground
I
actually
think
they
could
get
something
do
most
Americans
would
support
how
about
that
compromise
support
everybody
after
Newtown
and
ar
the
Aurora
Theater
say
we
need
something
to
somehow
deal
with
t
this
I
think
there
be
a
mental
health
but
the
transfer
of
weapon
that
require
no
background
check
whatever
he
be
say
baby
step
I
be
say
40
%
transfer
that
do
not
require
any
check
be
go
to
be
really
hard
to
deal
with
the
mental
health
piece
because
it
be
only
deal
with
the
6
%
that
do
wire
some
sort
of
background
check
you
have
to
combine
a
couple
to
make
they
work
excellent
point
Ben
tackle
that
the
loophole
call
in
the
vernacular
mean
private
transfer
do
not
have
to
be
record
with
mental
health
how
do
you
tackle
that
when
it
come
to
the
private
check
or
the
private
dealings
between
one
or
the
other
if
you
come
at
this
from
a
sensible
solution
which
be
hey
if
I
be
buy
a
gun
from
my
dad
for
example
who
be
in
law
enforcement
and
we
have
trade
gun
multiple
time
since
I
have
be
a
young
adult
that
be
a
example
of
where
if
you
have
a
caveat
for
that
I
think
you
can
find
common
ground
there
be
many
people
that
say
if
I
be
trade
a
gun
with
my
neighbor
or
with
a
hunting
buddy
where
he
say
you
know
what
I
really
would
love
to
have
that
30
aught
6
and
tired
of
my
38
over
here
let
do
a
trade
that
be
where
if
you
have
something
like
that
where
there
can
be
a
compromise
for
the
reality
that
do
take
place
a
lot
there
be
a
lot
of
people
in
hunting
club
for
example
that
have
club
gun
where
somebody
want
to
go
use
it
and
they
trade
with
another
person
right
but
then
the
--
happen
all
the
time
why
be
that
paperwork
so
onerous
so
onerous
to
ask
you
to
record
that
transaction
well
it
be
onerous
because
you
have
to
go
through
a
residenced
armed
dealer
pay
another
fee
on
top
of
it
depend
on
the
class
of
firearm
it
can
be
ex-kpleemly
expensive
and
in
some
case
set
up
a
trust
and
have
each
person
that
use
that
gun
on
a
trust
when
you
look
at
the
paperwork
I
point
to
the
federal
government
they
have
not
make
--
they
make
be
so
hard
to
do
these
thing
Stream
line
the
process
again
I
think
you
would
have
a
lot
of
people
that
would
agree
on
it
but
I
think
even
you
know
more
common
than
--
than
even
maybe
gun
show
and
more
common
than
you
know
hunting
club
be
just
intergeneration
transfer
you
have
a
grandfather
he
be
older
do
not
hunt
anymore
pass
it
down
those
be
fine
we
have
gun
my
whole
life
I
and
my
brother
and
I
do
not
think
--
other
than
the
BB
gun
and
pellet
gun
we
never
buy
those
gun
a
uncle
a
grandfather
--
lawmaker
do
not
need
to
tackle
that
I
be
say
that
I
be
say
just
because
the
father
and
grandfather
be
a
responsible
gun
own
hear
nothing
to
do
with
the
person
they
be
pass
it
down
to
right
I
do
believe
that
transfer
need
to
be
record
and
there
have
to
be
some
check
on
the
kind
of
the
mental
stability
and
kind
of
Crim
malbackground
of
the
person
come
into
possession
of
that
gun
right
now
that
be
not
necessarily
the
case
and
I
think
that
become
a
loophole
that
get
kind
of
fuzzy
for
people
because
we
want
to
say
it
be
in
my
family
I
should
be
able
to
do
whatever
I
want
to
within
my
family
it
do
not
work
that
way
last
word
Ben
many
people
will
say
this
--
it
be
not
a
loophole
because
there
be
already
a
law
that
say
that
if
you
be
a
convict
felon
you
be
not
allow
to
own
a
fire
warm
whether
it
be
give
to
you
or
not
you
can
not
own
it
you
can
not
purchase
it
sure
but
if
you
be
not
a
convict
felon
maybe
have
some
sort
of
mental
instability
not
record
that
become
a
issue
and
many
of
we
shooter
be
not
convict
felon
right
where
I
go
back
to
if
we
can
just
focus
first
off
on
the
mental
health
side
of
this
and
build
some
momentum
from
it
there
be
also
be
a
big
trust
issue
people
on
both
side
that
do
not
trust
the
other
side
and
think
they
be
always
go
to
go
for
something
a
step
further
if
they
can
just
focus
on
one
piece
at
a
time
that
could
be
where
we
could
actually
be
have
conversation
next
year
as
wow
we
do
some
good
this
year
and
it
make
sense
otherwise
we
will
not
get
anything
do
at
all
thanks
so
much
great
to
get
at
least
a
small
point
of
compromise
there
thanks
happy
new
year
over
to
Michaela
as
we
wenter
this
year

will
the
White
House
play
out
Hillary
Clinton

and
debris

the
blaze
we
want
to
bring
in
a
eyewitness
son
of
country
singer
Larry
Gatlin
Josh
urm
there
you
watch
this
happen
what
do
you
see
good
morning
good
morning
happy
new
year
to
all
of
you
yeah
last
night
we
have
reservation
at
a
restaurant
near
where
the
firework
extravaganza
be
to
go
off
we
--
to
be
honest
with
you
I
do
not
see
it
at
first
my
back
be
to
the
building
I
feel
the
heat
on
the
back
of
my
neck
do
not
really
turn
around
until
I
see
people
run
towards
I
with
they
iphone
I
turn
around
and
what
be
appear
to
be
maybe
isolate
fire
on
maybe
just
a
apartment
or
two
within
moment
seem
to
crawl
up
the
side
of
the
building
and
just
in
a
matter
of
seconds
engulf
it
Josh
with
the
threat
go
on
around
the
world
with
Isis
and
other
islamic
extremist
group
be
that
the
first
thought
that
cross
you
mind
something
nefarious
or
accidental
what
be
go
through
you
mind
I
think
no
matter
where
you
be
in
the
world
whether
my
hometown
of
Nashville
Tennessee
or
in
Dubai
of
course
those
thought
come
across
you
mind
when
you
see
something
like
that
but
more
importantly
you
see
where
the
danger
be
and
you
do
not
think
about
anything
else
it
be
just
my
immediate
reaction
be
to
remove
myself
my
wife
a
friend
that
be
with
we
just
to
remove
ourselves
from
the
danger
once
you
do
that
then
you
kind
of
assess
the
situation
and
try
and
make
the
best
decision
you
can
again
the
fact
that
I
be
in
Dubai
or
any
other
city
it
really
would
not
matter
at
that
point
it
be
just
remove
yourself
from
the
danger
and
regroup
Josh
it
seem
that
the
rest
of
the
festivity
in
Dubai
continue
that
night
do
it
seem
odd
or
do
it
work
that
everything
--
this
fire
start
at
local
time
you
time
with
midnight
only
a
couple
of
hour
away
do
you
think
they
would
cancel
it
or
be
it
natural
that
they
continue
with
the
festivity
I
get
to
be
honest
it
be
a
mixture
of
emotion
with
regard
to
that
of
course
when
you
be
look
out
one
eye
and
see
the
hotel
light
up
and
they
be
about
to
shoot
out
firework
and
out
of
the
corner
of
you
eye
you
see
this
other
building
on
fire
we
receive
report
that
there
be
no
fatality
if
I
can
I
would
say
base
on
what
I
see
be
no
minor
miracle
I
still
can
not
wrap
my
brain
around
the
fact
that
--
it
be
incredible
to
I
a
testament
to
--
you
know
there
be
all
kind
of
speculation
about
the
building
structure
and
response
and
whatever
else
I
can
tell
you
that
it
must
have
be
in
place
because
for
there
to
be
no
fatality
there
be
absolutely
a
miracle
and
so
I
guess
the
authority
they
know
that
they
feel
comfortable
go
ahead
and
I
feel
comfortable
standing
there
and
proceed
with
the
evening
watch
the
firework
but
also
at
the
same
time
be
fairly
vigilant
and
keep
a
eye
out
and
make
sure
that
everything
be
okay
other
witness
that
be
interview
there
that
be
even
a
little
closer
than
you
that
be
inside
the
hotel
say
it
start
on
the
20th
floor
and
folk
who
be
in
a
restaurant
nearby
hear
pop
that
they
think
be
early
firework
and
they
think
it
be
a
explosion
Josh

be
glad
you
be
safe
and
sound
this
morning

we

have
a
wrap-up
full
highlight
from
last

the
Fox
News
Christmas
--
new
year
eve
special
last
time
I
check
it
be
show
you
all
of
that
come
up
new
report
say
ISIS
be
on
its
heel
prepare
for
a
final
battle
with
the
West
but
be
the
terror
group
really
back
into
a
corner
thanks
to
air
strike
a
pilot
unbelievable
u-turn
it
be
a
flight
one
family
could
not
afford
to
but
they
almost
do
what
make
the
pilot
make
a
big
turn
around
you
do
not
want
to
miss
it
come
up
new
report
claim
ISIS
be
vow
a
strike
they
evacuate
two
strain
station
in
Munich
over
fear
of
a
new
year
eve
attack
Isis
goal
be
to
provoke
a
final
apocalyptic
battle
as
they
continue
air
strike
against
Isis
target
in
Iraq
and
Syria
be
this
for
real
or
a
sign
that
Isis
be
lose
grounds
Gorka
be
the
major
general
Matthew
Horner
distinguish
at
Marine
Corps
University
he
join
we
live
from
Tel
Aviv
Israel
Gorka
thank
you
for
join
we
this
morning
absolutely
happy
new
year
likewise
to
you
2016
for
Isis
be
they
try
to
provoke
a
final
showdown
in
the
name
of
they
english
language
magazine
or
be
they
grasp
at
other
alternative
I
wish
the
scenario
of
they
lose
ground
because
of
air
strike
would
be
true
but
it
really
be
not
this
be
a
insurgency
that
capture
territory
that
have
have
greater
expanse
in
the
United
Kingdom
more
than
6
million
people
live
on
Isis
territory
it
be
part
of
they
strategy
to
talk
about
the
apocalypse
to
say
that
this
be
the
final
jihad
they
capture
a
important
area
the
fact
be
unless
somebody
join
the
ground
effort
unless
there
be
in
addition
to
the
Kurds
local
army
with
we
adviser
that
take
the
fight
on
the
ground
to
Isis
Isis
will
continue
to
grow
air
force
air
strike
can
not
recapture
ground
territory
that
be
the
miss
part
of
the
puzzle
Pete
absolutely
Al
Baghdadi
put
out
a
message
call
for
more
attack
against
the
West
you
believe
--
it
be
you
sense
that
Isis
want
the
west
to
send
more
ground
troops
to
induce
the
fight
or
be
they
hope
we
will
not
so
they
can
continue
to
maintain
Mosul
and
Rack
we
have
another
isis
plot
unveil
in
New
York
and
Rochester
they
arrest
another
isis
suspect
they
would
like
to
see
the
infidel
troops
the
crusaders
as
they
call
it
in
they
mag
skbleen
come
to
the
Middle
East
to
prove
to
the
Muslims
that
this
be
the
final
jihad
this
be
the
holy
war
it
be
sort
of
a
binary
issue
they
want
to
do
attack
in
America
in
the
West
and
also
fight
the
last
Jihad
in
that
territory
of
Syria
and
Iraq
both
of
these
thing
be
part
of
they
strategy
it
promise
that
2016
will
continue
to
be
a
complex
environment
with
Isis
I
want
to
briefly
move
over
to
another
subject
near
and
dear
to
you
heart
you
visit
jordanian
refugee
camp
Gorka
do
you
believe
be
inside
the
refugee
camp
how
do
we
solve
and
or
address
the
refugee
crisis
do
it
mean
more
to
we
--
I
listen
to
the
Jordanians
my
wife
and
my
family
have
be
to
the
biggest
camp
in
Jordan
and
we
speak
to
the
refugee
the
Jordanians
they
say
that
the
solution
to
this
problem
be
not
to
keep
refugee
in
camp
or
send
they
further
north
into
Europe
or
West
into
America
it
be
to
get
they
back
into
Syria
as
soon
as
possible
to
stabilize
that
situation
we
have
to
understand
that
this
be
a
problem
that
will
not
be
solve
by
bring
refugee
to
America
that
be
the
bottom
line

the
State

not

outdo
on

be
probably
pay

be
scrutinize
we
now
page
of
Hillary
e-mail
just
release

the
ball
drop
last

that
be
right
the
perfect
moment
for
politics
everybody
talk
about
e-mail
they
be
suppose
to
have
82
%
release
by
the
end
of
the
new
year
they
do
not
reach
that
deadline
the
deadline
they
reach
be
go
over
275
of
the
page
be
classify
now
I
think
classified
e-mail
many
of
they
secret
they
reason
for
miss
that
deadline
Pete
be
because
of
the
holiday
which
creep
up
on
you
you
do
not
know
they
be
on
the
calendar
for
how
many
day
ALSOS
the
sheer
number
they
have
to
go
through
that
be
they
reasoning
here
be
some
of
the
e-mail
you
may
have
miss
the
first
one
this
be
a
classic
picture
everybody
know
Hillary
Clinton
with
that
blackberry
when
it
go
viral
Cheryl
Mills
she
chief
of
staff
say
the
message
from
Clinton
can
we
scroll
up
please
Clinton
say
why
now
that
be
on
the
way
to
Libya
you
look
cute
use
that
unauthorized
device
a
lot
of
thing
I
might
think
of
cute
might
not
be
the
word
there
be
the
photo
that
be
the
response
when
they
realize
it
go
viral
maybe
it
be
because
they
know
eventually
a
blackberry
and
e-mail
could
be
part
of
the
conversation
who
know
another
e-mail
that
come
up
there
be
who
get
to
ride
with
Hillary
Clinton
you
never
think
about
those
detail
the
Clinton
aide
spend
hour
with
a
flow
chart
to
determine
who
ride
with
she
if
you
look
at
it
what
it
would
have
take
tone
type
it
out
on
a
blackberry
it
be
a
linear
line
chart
that
say
if
she
be
there
if
not
Jake
Sullivan
if
not
then
who
then
there
be
a
decision
point
be
the
ambassador
tol
ashl
if
so
he
ride
with
she
they
be
enabler
not
people
to
hold
she
accountable
clearly
they
would
have
see
on
the
e-mail
address
where
it
come
from
that
it
be
not
a
authorize
account
it
question
she
judgment
and
the
people
that
she
surround
herself
with
if
you
have
ever
use
a
blackberry
or
a
smartphone
to
create
a
flow
chart
like
that
flow
chart
on
this
bad
boy
it
probably
would
have
take
two
hour
to
create
that
e-mail
that
be
manpower
time
to
create
that
flow
chart
with
a
blackberry
with
line
it
be
Clayton

last
night
be
scream
and
scream
I
get
it
from
talk
on
Fox
and
friends
and
wake
up
early
and
deal
with
kid
and
all
of
that
probably
get
to
be
a
common
thing
around

it
be
the
thing
be
when
we
produce
sound
the
way
you
make
that
noise
be
that
air
come
from
you
lung
and
through
these
vocal
cord
which
be
flap
on
you
windpipe
and
come
out
this
way
if
you
be
scream
you
be
put
more
strain
on
the
vocal
cord
imagine
if
you
be
blow
dry
you
hair
it
get
really
dry
that
be
the
point
of
it
the
same
way
if
you
be
blow
out
a
lot
of
air
through
you
vocal
cord
they
get
dry
there
be
certain
thing
you
should
do
I
drink
coffee
and
use
mouthwash
not
the
best
what
to
actually
do
--
that
be
a
good
thing
honey
can
help
with
suppressing
cough
and
sore
throat
especially
if
it
be
from
scream
you
want
to
stay
moisturize
use
the
humidifier
and
drink
plenty
of
water
stay
away
from
the
mouthwash
it
be
very
dry
alcohol
in
it
alcohol
coffee
too
can
dehydrate
you
as
well
if
you
have
a
sore
throat
from
a
cold
that
be
the
most
common
reason
that
you
have
sore
throat
for
that
you
have
to
wait
out
the
cold
but
you
can
have
tea
to
soothe
you
throat
add
honey
to
that
honey
what
do
the
honey
do
it
be
a
cough
suppressant
it
coat
the
throat
and
make
it
feel
better
it
be
help
with
the
symptom
you
can
do
the
same
thing
with
soup
hot
soup
to
stay
hydrated
as
well
of
course
you
can
try
the
over-the-counter
decongestant
be
aware
of
what
you
be
take
whether
it
be
nondrowsy
the
backstage
trick
for
the
Jersey
boys
be
lemon
honey
the
lemon
can
help
if
that
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
actually
other
people
can
have
problem
with
acid
reflux
especially
after
new
year
Lemon
can
make
that
worse
acidic
thing
can
trigger
that
if
you
stomach
be
here
the
acid
that
the
stomach
produce
come
towards
you
throat
people
who
have
a
worse
sore
throat
in
the
morning
might
have
sign
of
acid
reflux
even
the
pillow
can
affect
you
throat
the
pillow
can
help
you
if
you
be
stand
gravity
be
pull
that
acid
down
when
you
lay
down
you
actually
do
not
have
gravity
anymore
you
stack
up
you
pillow
at
night
that
be
a
easier
way
to
manage
acid
reflux
THAX
sense
how
about
allergy
or
allergen
this
be
a
big
problem
for
I
watery
eye
when
you
be
sleep
all
that
moisture
be
drip
at
the
back
of
you
throat
so
basically
you
start
to
have
a
sore
throat
from
the
irritation
you
can
take
Allegra
it
help
with
manage
the
symptom
you
can
take
nasal
steroid
which
can
manage
the
runny
nose
the
worst
case
scenario
benadryl
or
other
thing
the
easiest
way
to
manage

be
to
figure
out
what
you
be
allergic
to

down
coat

dep
--

often
you
almost

why

Nationwide

the
exclusive
insurance
partner
of
Plenti
it
be
not
too
late
to
make
a
new
year
resolution
have
you
think
of
a
digital
detox
new
research
say
quit
social
media
be
one
of
the
hardest
resolution
of
2016
Kurt
the
cyber
guy
be
here
to
help
we
free
ourselves
from
facebook
or
can
you
some
say
resolution
be
make
to
be
break
research
out
of
Cornell
say
a
little
bit
like
that
people
start
off
try
to
quit
social
media
and
for
one
reason
or
not
actually
four
of
they
they
will
go
back
to
it
--
back
to
the
social
media
like
facebook
or
they
will
use
it
as
a
reason
to
stay
further
away
from
it
first
up
we
be
addict
some
people
anyway
number
one
reason
someone
leave
facebook
be
they
feel
addict
to
it
that
be
what
the
study
out
of
Cornell
University
say
there
be
a
web
create
call
99
day
there
be
90
day
of
freedom
off
of
the
website
and
every
month
they
check
in
to
see
where
they
be
the
people
be
track
and
find
out
there
be
four
thing
that
they
really
focus
in
on
that
they
could
say
be
the
reason
I
either
leave
facebook
or
that
they
have
to
kb
back
after
a
while
addiction
be
number
one
on
the
list
number
two
have
to
do
with
privacy
and
surveillance
people
do
not
like
the
fact
that
we
be
be
watch
all
the
time
when
they
disconnect
from
facebook
they
find
ironically
that
hey
it
be
kind
of
nice
not
to
have
everybody
watch
I
all
the
time
at
the
same
time
it
turn
around
there
be
a
subset
of
the
same
people
have
say
I
do
not
mind
that
so
I
be
go
to
go
back
even
faster
because
I
like
for
people
to
know
where
I
be
and
I
feel
safer
that
way
what
about
the
mood
it
put
we
in
sometimes
it
make
we
have
a
hard
time
want
to
keep
up
with
the
Joneses
or
look
at
a
Exxon
social
media
we
get
preoccupy
and
we
already
know
right
when
we
look
at
facebook
a
lot
and
we
see
how
everybody
post
picture
of
smile
and
my
gosh
everybody
be
live
such
a
better
life
than
I
right
it
make
we
feel
bad
we
know
that
to
be
true
what
be
interesting
when
people
be
in
better
mood
they
tend
to
go
back
to
facebook
and
they
want
to
share
it
that
be
another
factor
why
it
be
so
tough
to
quit
facebook
for
longer
than
90
day
they
want
to
share
what
be
great
in
they
life
when
something
good
happen
you
want
to
call
you
mom
or
best
friend
or
you
spouse
now
everybody
want
to
share
it
on
social
media
exactly
what
about
other
site
they
get
lure
away
from
facebook
that
be
the
other
factor
of
why
it
be
--
why
people
quit
facebook
be
that
they
maybe
with
the
instagram
or
twitter
they
prefer
that
a
lot
that
keep
they
away
and
they
be
fine
with
that
I
have
a
very
interesting
friend
a
attorney
he
have
move
to
another
state
and
need
to
take
the
bar
he
say
you
know
what
I
be
work
full-time
I
need
to
unplug
from
this
he
unplug
for
two
month
from
facebook
do
he
pass
he
do
really
well
I
say
what
do
you
learn
from
that
experience
he
say
number
one
I
have
no
idea
how
much
of
my
life
be
spend
in
sort
of
a
useless
part
of
interact
with
facebook
on
the
other
hand
when
the
two
month
be
over
I
be
happy
to
go
back
I
miss
see
my
family
photo
and
what
my
friend
be
up
to
that
be
the
core
reason
and
the
way
that
we
share
online
it
be
like
have
a
e-mail
address
or
phone
number
these
day
it
be
one
tip
to
stay
away
from
facebook
some
people
really
want
--
they
be
feed
up
new
year
resolution
I
be
feed
up
my
tip
be
do
not
delete
that
be
the
biggest
mistake
eventually
you
want
to
go
back
and
start
over
again
there
be
a
function
on
facebook
that
allow
you
to
suspend
you
account
when
you
decide
to
come
back
you
turn
it
back
on
without
any
big
hassle
in
the
meantime
you
friend
will
not
even
see
that
you
be
on
facebook
at
that
time
it
be
like
freezing
a
magazine
subscription
right
thanks
for
the
tip
come
up
he
be
do
it
again

the
political

about
to
pick
up
speed
the
Iowa
caucus
just
one
month
away
it
will
be
the
first
time
that
we
have
real
result
from
real
voter
we
can
not
mindlessly
speculate
anymore
that
be
over
right
and
we
actually
have
a
real
political
panel
here
now
to
give
insight
CNN
political
commentator
and
former
communication
director
foresenator
Ted
Cruz
Amanda
Carpenter
and
former
Reagan
White
House
Jeffrey
Lorde
trump
supporter
and
CNN
political
commentator
and
Jeb
Bush
supporter
Anna
good
to
see
you
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
to
you
too
great
to
have
you
with
we
today
okay
Anna
start
with
you
look
into
you
crystal
ball
what
be
about
to
happen
now
oh
Lord
Alisyn
that
crystal
ball
be
--
be
so
--
so
hard
to
read
in
2015
I
be
not
sure
I
be
go
to
do
a
better
job
of
it
in
2016
but
you
be
right
we
be
in
the
sprint
Chris
I
be
glad
very
happy
to
tell
you
we
do
have
about
two
more
week
of
mindless
speculation
leave
oh
good
you
know
you
do
know
that
--
Iowa
voter
New
Hampshire
voter
these
folk
just
take
they
time
they
like
to
look
under
the
hood
and
a
lot
of
they
half
of
they
do
not
make
up
they
mind
until
that
last
week
but
certainly
we
be
in
the
sprint
I
think
you
be
go
see
a
lot
of
candidate
spend
a
lot
of
time
some
of
they
focus
on
Iowa
some
more
focus
on
New
Hampshire
too
reasonable
bite
off
stuff
and
chew
on
it
oh
good
Jeffrey
Lorde
the
proposition
tell
I
why
it
be
true
false
in
the
new
year
Trump
can
not
hold
on
in
Iowa
the
evangelical
base
too
big
they
do
not
like
the
negativity
they
go
Cruz
true
or
false
and
why
sure
possible
sure
possible
possible
absolutely
the
one
thing
--
what
be
all
the
hedge
Jeffrey
come
on
it
be
2016
take
a
risk
be
you
ask
I
could
Ted
Cruz
win
this
in
Iowa
yes
the
question
be
what
can
he
do
beyond
that
and
the
one
thing
that
I
would
add
be
--
Ronald
Range
of
course
lose
Iowa
and
become
president
Rick
Santorum
and
Governor
Huckabee
both
win
Iowa
and
never
become
president
so
win
Iowa
in
and
of
itself
do
not
do
anything
I
really
do
think
this
be
go
to
be
a
long
march
here
a
long
March
New
Hampshire
South
Carolina
Nevada
and
on
beyond
that
so
whoever
win
even
if
Donald
Trump
win
Iowa
that
be
not
go
to
solve
anything
Amanda
or
settle
anything
Ning
Iowa
do
not
mean
anything
it
be
always
good
to
win
Iowa
here
be
the
thing
it
do
not
crown
a
king
but
knock
out
a
lot
of
princes
remember
how
big
the
field
be
they
be
go
to
get
knock
out
and
then
another
big
shape-up
when
the
polling
be
redistribute
the
guy
in
the
undercard
debate
may
only
have
1
%
or
2
%
but
that
can
mean
a
lot
for
the
top
tier
candidate
after
Iowa
a
big
shake-up
and
may
start
again
it
be
always
good
to
win
but
win
Iowa
be
not
everything
I
can
not
trust
the
other
two
with
this
next
one
Amanda
so
I
will
stay
with
you
after
what
we
see
with
JEB
at
the
most
recent
debate
--
you
be
sick
of
it
say
it
again
Trump
look
at
JEB
and
say
who
be
talkin
I
or
you
I
be
talk
a
little
of
that
action
what
Jeb
Bush
do
I
say
a
new
Jeb
Bush
decide
to
be
the
anti-trump
and
it
be
go
to
give
he
a
boost
yes
or
no
Amanda
yeah
it
be
always
good
to
see
JEB
assert
himself
on
the
national
stage
I
think
a
lot
of
people
be
claim
for
that
wait
to
see
real
personality
come
out
the
less
guard
Jeb
Bush
be
the
better
for
Hill
that
say
I
still
think
it
be
a
bad
idea
for
Jeb
Bush
to
define
he
candidacy
via
trump
he
need
to
be
he
own
man
quit
look
back
on
he
Florida
record
try
to
run
on
that
and
look
forward
at
the
current
fight
that
have
happen
with
the
Obama
administration
and
get
in
the
middle
of
that
ANA
you
be
close
of
course
to
Jeb
Bush
be
that
the
moment
in
the
last
CNN
debate
where
he
find
he
sea
leg
do
he
feel
that
he
find
he
voice
that
night
you
know
I
be
see
a
different
Jeb
Bush
in
the
last
several
week
I
think
that
really
since
what
seem
like
ancient
history
but
since
the
very
bad
debate
in
boulder
I
think
he
figure
out
theatric
be
part
of
the
job
description
and
be
now
do
it
I
also
see
he
do
much
more
focus
on
New
Hampshire
which
I
think
be
smart
you
know
as
we
have
discuss
Iowa
mean
something
it
do
not
mean
everything
the
only
time
Iowa
mean
something
huge
be
when
it
be
a
upset
like
in
2008
when
Barack
Obama
upset
then
Hillary
Clinton
if
we
see
that
kind
of
thing
either
on
the
Democrat
or
Republican
side
it
would
be
huge
on
Jeb
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
he
you
know
keep
grind
away
a
lot
of
retail
politics
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
early
state
New
Hampshire
and
South
Carolina
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
he
try
to
do
this
the
old-fashioned
way
one
voter
at
a
time
Amanda
you
want
to
jump
in
yeah
one
thing
about
that
the
interesting
part
of
the
new
JEB
dynamic
be
that
a
rise
JEB
a
rise
Chris
Christie
make
life
a
lot
harder
for
Marco
Rubio
in
many
way
they
be
compete
for
the
same
type
of
voter
and
the
more
they
clash
the
more
you
know
those
three
continue
to
be
competitive
with
each
other
make
it
easier
for
a
Cruz
or
a
trump
to
take
the
bigger
lane
actually
I
think
it
be
the
two
young
buck
lock
horn
and
I
think
we
will
continue
to
see
Cruz
and
Rubio
who
be
so
evenly
match
true
both
rookie
senator
who
be
you
know
both
lawyer
very
different
style
one
go
poetic
the
other
one
go
legalese
on
we
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
the
two
of
they
clash
a
lot
which
I
be
not
sure
do
not
open
up
a
space
for
another
candidate
maybe
Jefferies
maybe
somebody
else
what
about
this
one
the
chance
Donald
Trump
pick
as
female
run
mate
before
the
convention
before
the
convention
yes
possible
yeah
sure
I
can
see
it
possible
it
be
possible
that
Alisyn
knock
I
unconscious
in
the
next
15
seconds
probable
you
know
I
think
sure
absolutely
absolutely
I
mean
if
Donald
Trump
win
this
nomination
or
it
become
certain
ahead
of
time
he
be
go
to
do
it
yeah
yes
that
be
possible
he
couldfiorina
come
on
Jeffrey
he
can
not
stand
carly
Fiorina
he
be
say
over
and
over
again
five
minute
of
hear
she
voice
be
--
but
wait
wait
wait
wait
wait
JFK
could
not
stand
Lyndon
Johnson
either
but
he
make
he
vice
president
yeah
well
Donald
Trump
be
no
jfk
there
be
one
--
one
other
thing
here
I
really
do
think
this
be
go
to
be
the
year
of
the
outsider
again
the
election
year
itself
so
whether
it
be
Donald
Trump
or
Ted
Cruz
or
whoever
I
think
the
outside
be
win
and
that
be
why
Donald
Trump
pick
on
Jeb
Bush
all
the
time
not
because
he
think
he
be
a
threat
but
Jeb
Bush
be
the
symbol
of
the
establishment
and
whether
it
be
Jeb
Bush
or
John
Kasich
or
some
of
these
other
I
think
that
be
a
real
weakness
and
I
think
somebody
on
the
outside
be
go
to
win
this
nomination
I
think
we
be
go
to
leave
it
there
absolutely
Jeffrey
--
happy
new
year

you
guy
thank
you
Amanda
Ana

the
time
to
walk
the
walk
and
just
one
month
the
election
season
really
get
under
way
the
Iowa
caucus
have
not
be
yet
no
no
once
the
ballot
go
everything
become
the
real
show
it
be
go
to
be
a
slog
for
the
White
House
after
that
so
let
talk
about
the
Democrats
you
get
Hillary
and
Bernie
up
on
top
what
do
they
need
to
do
to
get
the
nomination
Maria
Cardona
democratic
strategist
Donna
Brazile
political
strategist
and
CNN
Democratic
strategist
Paul
Begala
we
be
not
change
in
2016
you
be
attach
to
a
Hillary
Super
Pac
and
the
title
all
the
time
whenever
you
guy
come
in
full
disclosure
people
should
know
that
I
be
pay
by
a
super
pac
good
to
know
when
we
pllook
at
it
you
have
Hillary
and
Bernie
you
do
not
believe
that
Hillary
will
not
win
the
nomination
right
of
course
I
be
for
she
and
try
to
geld
she
nominate
even
if
I
be
not
she
have
a
commanding
lead
the
party
like
she
even
among
Bernie
voter
she
have
a
stratospherically
high
voting
rate
what
about
she
be
potentially
problematic
he
strength
with
young
people
could
be
a
challenge
for
she
that
be
to
say
you
can
not
be
president
in
my
party
unless
you
excite
young
people
Bernie
be
do
that
Hillary
have
to
find
a
way
to
match
that
he
have
a
energy
with
young
people
it
be
trick
for
he
and
for
the
party
a
challenge
for
Hillary
meet
he
among
the
younger
voter
and
try
to
challenge
and
beat
he
there
Maria
look
into
you
crystal
ball
if
you
would
for
2016
what
happen
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
I
think
actually
that
Hillary
Clinton
will
win
Iowa
I
think
hopefully
she
will
also
win
New
Hampshire
I
be
also
a
hillary
supporter
but
I
think
Bernie
will
continue
to
hang
on
he
have
a
lot
of
money
he
have
the
ability
to
go
back
to
those
donor
because
he
have
a
lot
of
small
dollar
donor
he
would
do
very
well
in
Iowa
he
could
do
very
well
in
New
Hampshire
which
be
the
neighboring
state
and
be
the
closest
he
be
the
closest
they
have
to
a
favorite
son
he
will
do
obviously
very
well
in
Vermont
and
Massachusetts
in
the
Northeast
so
I
think
that
the
robust
dialogue
that
they
have
between
the
two
of
they
which
will
focus
on
make
sure
that
middle-class
family
have
what
they
need
not
just
to
survive
but
to
succeed
in
this
economy
be
a
very
good
one
for
the
democratic
party
Donna
how
do
she
deal
with
the
upside-down
positive
negative
when
it
come
to
trustworthiness
and
rating
overall
continue
to
reach
out
touch
voter
and
convince
they
she
be
the
right
person
at
this
time
to
lead
the
country
I
be
neutral
vice
chair
of
the
democratic
party
and
I
do
believe
Bernie
Sanders
have
a
high
probability
of
win
one
of
those
early
contest
he
have
a
lot
of
enthusiasm
he
be
be
able
to
raise
a
lot
of
money
many
of
he
donor
have
not
max
out
so
we
be
go
to
have
a
competitive
primary
season
yes
Hillary
Clinton
be
very
favorable
in
the
poll
but
Bernie
Sanders
have
prove
that
he
be
up
to
the
task
of
address
some
of
these
dbig
issue
that
demm
care
about
the
economy
he
be
address
of
course
criminal
justice
reform
and
I
just
want
to
make
sure
it
be
a
neutral
party
that
I
can
talk
about
both
candidate
I
like
they
both
and
of
course
we
still
have
Martin
who
be
out
there
still
try
to
get
to
first
base
there
you
go
Paul
obviously
always
surprise
you
can
never
guard
against
what
surprise
might
crop
up
2015
certainly
fill
with
many
surprise
care
to
predict
what
be
go
to
happen
on
the
other
side
you
know
we
have
all
sit
around
for
the
last
six
month
as
donald
trump
dominate
and
presume
all
professional
--
well
trump
will
go
away
and
then
what
you
know
the
last
month
of
this
year
last
year
he
do
not
go
away
he
keep
go
up
and
I
think
Democrats
now
have
to
be
prepare
for
a
trump
nomination
and
he
be
enormously
talented
fatally
flaw
I
do
not
think
he
can
be
president
but
upend
the
Republican
Party
fatally
flaw
be
exactly
what
the
GOP
say
about
Hillary
Clinton
and
if
you
face
Donald
Trump
how
do
you
think
she
weather
the
relentless
batter
he
will
give
you
on
all
the
thing
you
do
not
like
to
talk
about
Trump
against
Hillary
I
would
I
would
bet
the
farm
here
why
why
on
that
he
love
to
attack
but
he
be
a
bully
bully
back
down
when
you
stand
up
to
they
Donald
Trump
could
not
last
three
hour
in
a
debate
have
to
negotiate
it
down
to
two
Hillary
testify
under
wither
opponent
and
do
not
faint
or
negotiate
down
to
two
hour
and
truth
and
hyperbole
where
be
you
e-mail
why
do
you
let
those
people
die
in
den
Ben
Gauzy
I
do
not
think
daunt
be
the
right
word
anybody
in
politics
that
be
be
try
and
that
have
be
under
the
gauntlet
it
be
Hillary
Clinton
and
I
think
that
she
supporter
within
the
democratic
party
which
I
think
be
a
huge
point
here
you
know
you
all
love
to
talk
about
she
favorability
or
unfavorability
as
it
be
if
Donald
Trump
be
the
nominee
I
completely
agree
with
Paul
Republican
need
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
real
possibility
he
will
be
the
nominee
then
you
have
the
contrast
between
somebody
like
Donald
Trump
who
if
he
be
the
nominee
will
get
there
with
probably
not
a
whole
lot
of
favor
act
amongst
the
Republican
Party
it
be
very
low
favorability
for
he
right
now
versus
Hillary
Clinton
who
be
probably
up
to
80
%
favorability
among
she
own
party
that
be
where
you
start
to
actually
win
a
general
election
race
so
she
start
from
a
very
positive
point
of
voter
within
she
own
party
and
then
she
can
energize
and
mobilize
other
who
will
see
trump
as
a
fatally
flawed
candidate
and
the
contrast
between
she
enthusiasm
optimism
for
this
country
versus
the
kind
of
language
he
have
be
use
which
essentially
devalue
we
american
principle
will
be
a
fantastic
contrast
for
she
and
I
think
will
help
she
win
the
general
election
and
yet
Donna
in
head-to-head
matchup
in
those
poll
she
do
not
run
away
with
it
because
we
live
in
a
very
polarize
divide
country
but
I
want
to
be
a
contrarian
this
morning
and
I
think
Ted
Cruz
I
think
we
need
to
look
at
Ted
Cruz
Ted
Cruz
have
really
come
up
in
the
poll
recently
he
have
a
a
very
good
ground
operation
in
Iowa
and
ready
to
compete
in
all
of
those
so-called
super
Tuesday
southern
SEC
primary
so
I
think
Ted
Cruz
have
be
the
sleeper
in
the
race
I
think
Donald
Trump
be
go
to
come
under
another
difficult
storm
this
one
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
a
anchor
with
the
republican
base
and
I
think
Ted
Cruz
be
the
candidate
we
should
watch
out
for
Donna
Paul
Maria
happy
new
year
thanks
so
much
for
be
here
happy
new
year
to
you
thanks
guy
Michaela
guy
in
2016
we
could
see
life-changing
medical
breakthrough
Sanjay
Gupta
be
here
to
talk
about
that
and
how
eliminate
one
thing
from
you
diet
could
really
improve
you
health
we
do
it
for
the
one
who
rise
before
it
shine
the
one
who
labor
for
what
they
love
because
at
banquet
we
believe
that
every
dollar
should
work
as
hard
as
the
family
that
earn
it
that
be
why
we
be
make
we
meal
better
like
use
100
%
natural
chicken
breast
in
we
chicken
strip
and
add
real
cream
to
we
mashed
potato
so
now
there
be
more
to
love
with
banquet
now
serve
a
better
banquet
Sax
always
make
I
think
of
drunk
thought
you
know
do
it
a
little
woozy
boozie

make
I
a
little
nostalgic

poignance

that
be
a
look
at
the
headline
I
be
Fredricka
Whitfield
Michaela
back
to
you
whenever
there
be
important
health
news
we
chief
medical
correspondent
Sanjay
Gupta
be
the
man
to
turn
to
do
break
it
all
down
for
we
this
morning
we
be
look
ahead
to
2016
for
reason
to
be
hopeful
when
it
come
to
we
health
in
the
new
year
Sanjay
Gupta
join
we
now
from
Atlanta
we
probably
should
be
talk
about
hangover
remedy
but
we
will
stick
to
the
thing
that
a
lot
of
we
be
really
feel
start
to
resonate
with
we
we
know
a
few
week
ago
Jimmy
Carter
former
president
announce
he
a
cancer-free
at
age
91
talk
about
this
because
this
have
get
to
represent
really
good
news
for
other
cancer
patient
I
think
it
absolutely
do
and
keep
in
mind
that
he
be
91
year
old
so
you
know
it
say
many
thing
good
news
for
cancer
patient
across
the
board
but
also
people
who
be
older
always
weigh
this
idea
should
I
get
therapy
too
hard
on
my
body
still
important
question
at
91
he
be
do
well
keep
in
mind
Michaela
he
have
metastatic
melanoma
a
type
of
skin
cancer
that
spread
throughout
he
body
find
in
he
liver
and
brain
and
he
get
a
operation
on
he
liver
to
remove
that
radiation
to
he
brain
and
take
another
drug
know
as
a
amino
therapy
drug
and
it
seem
to
at
least
at
this
time
be
work
there
be
no
evidence
that
the
cancer
be
in
he
body
he
get
scan
and
it
do
not
show
it
and
he
say
he
be
feel
well
so
finger
be
cross
but
this
be
again
pretty
exciting
news
that
he
seem
to
at
least
be
free
of
cancer
at
this
time
a
couple
of
point
to
remember
he
be
a
extraordinary
human
being
he
have
beat
the
odds
in
a
number
of
way
here
we
know
he
be
make
of
other
stuff
but
the
fact
that
he
be
91
I
mean
that
be
truly
truly
remarkable
and
speak
to
the
science
and
where
the
science
be
go
that
be
where
I
think
we
be
feel
most
hopeful
correct
I
think
so
let
I
tell
you
these
immunotherapy
drug
we
have
be
hear
about
these
generally
for
several
year
but
the
drug
he
be
on
be
just
approve
last
year
or
in
2014
it
be
amazing
think
of
it
like
this
Michaela
you
be
develop
cancer
in
you
body
in
the
time
we
be
talk
and
you
immune
system
be
fight
that
constant
war
in
you
body
what
happen
include
certain
type
of
cancer
include
he
melanoma
this
drug
turn
on
the
immune
system
back
on
and
let
the
body
do
what
it
can
do
let
the
immune
system
fight
the
cancer
it
be
remarkable
if
it
work
seem
to
be
in
he
case
significant
forelot
of
patient
out
there
good
news
on
the
cdc
on
the
Hive
HIV-AIDS
Chase
way
up
among
two
group
what
be
those
two
group
and
a
overall
look
where
this
epidemic
be
head
overall
number
be
down
you
mention
significant
dip
for
a
period
of
time
and
plateaue
among
gay
bisexual
latino
man
between
the
age
of
13
rand
24
young
man
it
be
go
up
go
up
still
87
%
in
term
of
new
case
wow
pretty
significant
we
have
make
a
lot
of
progress
in
term
of
treatment
as
you
know
the
cocktail
of
drug
have
turn
people
who
have
this
diagnosis
into
one
with
chronic
disease
as
oppose
to
a
death
sentence
you
have
hear
that
and
there
be
new
medication
with
90
%
sort
of
significance
they
can
decrease
the
likelihood
that
you
will
become
infected
with
hiv-aid
really
almost
act
like
a
preventive
these
be
really
important
development
rchltd
and
the
new
AIDS
vaccine
about
to
do
a
trial
here
in
the
United
States
yeah
Robert
Gallo
remember
he
name
the
one
really
the
first
person
to
associate
the
fact
that
this
thing
know
at
now
everyone
know
at
hiv
be
cause
infection
people
do
not
know
this
before
some
of
he
work
it
be
he
trial
he
be
be
work
on
this
for
a
long
time
it
have
not
really
start
go
into
phase
one
trial
but
already
go
through
animal
study
and
he
be
optimistic
about
it
I
think
the
scientific
world
be
pay
attention
short
of
a
vaccine
Michaela
so
many
thing
people
can
do
absolutely
the
preventative
get
test
make
sure
they
be
always
practice
safe
sex
awareness
be
key
here
good
news
on
the
diabetes
front
remarkable
the
first
time
in
25
year
the
case
of
new
diabetes
drop
what
be
go
on
it
be
work
we
be
pay
attention
make
change
I
feel
like
people
be
actually
pay
attention
when
we
talk
kind
of
nice
you
know
look
here
be
what
we
be
say
a
few
year
ago
by
the
year
2020
half
the
country
would
either
have
diabetes
or
pre-diabetic
half
the
country
now
we
be
see
as
you
point
out
for
the
first
time
there
have
be
fewer
new
case
of
diabetes
in
this
country
it
be
--
it
be
great
news
just
to
give
you
context
--
million
new
case
the
year
before
and
now
million
new
case
this
year
not
a
huge
drop
but
look
we
think
we
be
--
right
we
be
exercise
more
we
be
eat
less
we
be
drink
less
soda
people
be
generally
aware
we
need
to
be
healthy
not
as
sedentary
as
they
use
to
be
more
healthy
choice
available
they
make
a
difference
speaking
of
healthy
choice
you
have
be
a
proponent
of
UT
cut
sugar
out
of
a
person
diet
talk
about
that
quickly
new
study
show
how
beneficial
that
one
move
significant
for
some
of
we
but
that
can
really
contribute
to
better
health
there
be
no
question
what
be
fascinating
about
this
study
really
good
news
if
you
just
cut
out
add
sugar
out
of
you
diet
just
the
add
sugar
for
ten
day
we
be
not
ask
people
to
change
they
entire
life
ten
day
of
cut
out
add
sugar
you
could
decrease
fatty
component
in
you
blood
know
at
triglyceride
reduce
blood
pressure
and
decrease
you
chance
of
develop
heart
disease
or
stroke
obviously
you
want
to
keep
it
up
after
the
ten
day
the
point
be
that
just
as
quickly
as
sugar
can
have
these
adverse
effect
in
you
body
you
can
get
rid
of
those
adverse
effect
in
you
body
quickly
what
a
great
time
to
do
it
begin
of
the
year
hello
it
make
as
huge
difference
in
term
of
overall
survival
and
how
you
feel
ct
exactly
why
I
want
to
talk
to
you
on
this
day
because
people
be
start
new
year
resolution
a
good
time
to
start
something
like
this
try
it
out
see
if
you
can
stick
to
it
Sanjay
Gupta
nobody
better
I
like
to
start
the
new
year
out
with
happy
new
year
you
too
saw
startling
ruling
from
the
Supreme
Court
same-sex
marriage
affordable
care
act
now
that
we
be
begin
2016
what
be
next
here
to
break
it
down
legal
analyst
and
criminal
defense
attorney
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
a
favorite
start
with
armyffirmative
actio
be
it
do
affirmative
action
could
go
away
and
be
around
some
time
the
Supreme
Court
have
not
really
speak
on
it
in
a
while
but
at
issue
here
be
whether
or
not
the
University
of
Texas
can
use
sort
of
that
holistic
approach
in
which
they
take
race
into
account
when
decide
who
get
into
the
enter
freshman
class
at
Texas
hmm
now
Justice
Scalia
make
some
headline
a
little
while
ago
bring
up
he
brief
submit
that
show
research
controversial
research
that
when
you
look
at
AFRICAN-AMERICANS
in
the
science
field
that
the
higher
perform
professional
have
go
to
second
tier
college
or
not
the
top
top
top
college
and
the
suggestion
be
maybe
affirmative
action
be
put
in
place
they
be
not
go
to
do
as
well
what
do
you
think
about
that
always
a
issue
measure
discriminatory
impact
do
you
look
at
you
end
datum
and
decide
whether
or
not
there
be
discrimination
or
racial
inequality
just
base
on
that
datum
you
know
ultimately
when
it
come
to
aaffirmative
action
it
be
catch
in
a
bit
of
a
Gordian
knot
itself
because
how
do
you
achieve
racial
diversity
use
racially
neutral
criterion
it
may
be
something
that
be
possible
in
theory
but
simply
impossible
in
practice
and
the
supreme
court
hat
to
make
a
decision
usually
there
to
divine
with
the
rule
be
here
to
divine
a
exception
to
the
rule
with
affirmative
action
abortion
tell
we
about
the
case
another
point
the
Supreme
Court
have
not
really
visit
Ntd
a
long
time
the
issue
be
basically
this
--
the
rule
since
planned
parenthood
be
that
the
government
can
put
restriction
on
a
woman
right
to
get
a
abortion
but
they
may
not
create
what
be
call
a
undue
burden
I
put
that
in
quote
because
the
Supreme
Court
have
give
we
virtually
no
guidance
whatsoever
as
to
what
a
undue
burden
be
so
in
the
present
case
you
could
boil
it
down
to
this
--
be
it
a
undue
burden
if
you
heighten
standard
on
abortion
clinic
such
that
citizen
in
a
state
have
to
drive
a
extra
three
hour
to
find
a
abortion
clinic
now
that
be
a
oversimplification
basically
it
be
require
Nuk
number
one
that
physician
perform
abortion
be
admit
at
a
hospital
within
30
mile
and
number
two
it
heighten
the
standard
of
a
abortion
clinic
so
that
it
must
be
equal
to
a
surgical
center
now
the
net
effect
of
that
be
that
it
less
and
less
clinic
will
meet
that
criterion
as
a
result
some
have
to
close
and
there
simply
will
be
less
clinic
available
to
citizen
of
that
state
so
the
question
be
be
that
a
undue
burden
access
versus
avoid
have
a
chop
shop
mentality
right
what
the
opponent
of
the
increase
standard
say
we
want
it
to
be
as
healthy
and
safe
for
people
as
possible
of
course
why
we
have
all
kind
of
rule
and
standard
for
hospital
and
medical
facility
to
protect
citizen
of
course
what
the
proponent
of
the
law
argue
the
only
reason
we
have
the
rule
to
make
abortion
safer
people
who
oppose
the
law
say
no
no
no
while
it
may
make
they
safer
the
neglect
effect
make
it
more
difficult
to
find
a
place
that
can
do
a
abortion
therefore
undue
burden
be
achieve
not
to
make
it
better
how
to
make
it
harder
be
it
a
legal
issue
a
complicated
case
how
about
Mary
Jane
marijuana
make
its
way
through
ditch
state
legislature
find
fairly
significant
legal
approval
on
the
federal
scale
what
do
you
think
we
will
see
there
as
a
criminal
defense
attorney
I
be
grapple
with
this
I
feel
in
the
trench
when
it
come
to
the
legality
of
marijuana
because
we
be
in
a
bit
of
a
crisis
of
federalism
because
under
federal
law
marijuana
be
still
illegal
it
be
a
schedule
drug
but
when
you
get
out
to
place
like
California
legality
of
marijuana
it
be
not
just
county
by
county
anymore
it
be
city
by
city
when
you
talk
about
patchwork
legislation
marijuana
be
this
battlefield
it
be
impossible
as
a
citizen
to
know
where
you
stand
whether
or
not
marijuana
be
legal
in
you
state
even
if
it
be
legal
it
may
be
illegal
under
federal
law
so
we
be
in
a
bit
of
a
quagmire
when
it
come
to
marijuana
legislation
and
all
we
can
really
hope
for
in
the
coming
year
be
some
clarity
at
least
as
we
march
state
march
towards
legalization
at
least
we
hope
that
we
march
towards
some
sort
of
inuniformi
whether
yea
or
Nay
how
do
you
get
that
from
the
Supreme
Court
this
be
not
for
we
it
be
a
law
make
it
legal
it
be
legal
make
it
illegal
it
be
illegal
we
can
not
give
you
a
higher
sense
no
pun
intend
a
compelling
argument
right
state
traditionally
have
reserve
power
to
legislate
in
this
area
but
of
course
the
federal
government
have
choose
to
outlaw
marijuana
marijuana
under
federal
law
so
it
be
not
just
a
question
of
whether
state
have
the
rights
to
legislate
in
this
area
it
be
a
question
of
the
conflict
of
the
federal
government
preemption
against
state
law
we
have
not
see
a
case
yet
where
somebody
bring
it
from
one
state
to
another
they
get
catch
in
the
interstate
movement
wind
ufr
a
federal
case
and
it
get
jam
up
that
be
the
way
we
will
see
this

Jennifer
Lawrence
be
go
to
be
contender
for
best
actress
spotlight
little
heavier
the
drama
about
the
Boston
Globe
seem
like
it
be
get
a
real
great
chance
I
want
to
talk
about
Jennifer
Lawrence
because
when
she
pair
with
Bradley
Cooper
it
seem
to
be
box
office
gold
magic
absolutely
and
I
think
we
might
have
that
again
absolutely
and
already
we
be
wait
on
the
Oscar
nomination
but
already
for
the
Golden
Globe
we
know
Jennifer
Lawrence
be
the
one
to
beat
in
that
category
they
be
in
about
ten
day
then
we
be
go
to
get
the
Oscar
nomination
14
day
after
yep
and
the
Golden
Globes
set
up
the
oscar
really
nicely
people
debate
how
influential
they
be
but
a
great
start
to
the
season
and
then
we
get
the
real
show
the
academy
award
later
these
two
be
constantly
in
the
movie
together
I
just
feel
like
at
any
minute
they
should
start
date
I
want
to
talk
about
Lee
for
that
doedic
dicaprio
he
have
stiff
competition
Mark
Roufolo
Michael
Keaton
there
be
a
lot
of
contender
this
time
will
Smith
for
concussion
Michael
Fassbender
for
the
Steve
Jobs
film
interesting
to
see
a
little
nos
nostalgia
too
with
creed
and
do
you
think
sly
stalone
and
that
franchise
part
of
that
realm
he
be
you
guy
I
love
he
the
actor
that
play
creed
son
I
can
only
tell
you
he
character
in
all
my
child
that
be
when
I
start
watch
he
he
play
creed
son
and
he
want
to
go
to
sly
stalone
to
have
he
train
right
yeah
there
be
so
much
nostalgia
with
the
film
but
it
be
go
to
be
very
tough
for
a
film
like
this
do
you
think
I
do
maybe
a
nod
for
sly
look
at
the
Golden
Globe
nomination
Mad
Max
and
Carroll
and
--
but
I
think
a
lot
of
people
would
love
to
see
it
who
do
you
think
be
go
to
take
it
a
away
certainly

of
the

joy
the
right
time

$
334
million
that
be
the
12th
highest
in
the
history
of
the
game
so
the
next
drawing
be
tomorrow
night
you
odds
of
win
just
1
in
292
million
so
you
know
the
odds
be
somewhat
steep
buy
a
ticket
a
chance
there
be
a
chance
there
be
a
chance
more
of
a
chance
of
be
strike
by
lightning
than
win
the
powerball
and
Pete
Hegseth
do
math
in
public
I
have
see
it
so
I
want
to
know
not
well
I
just
do
some
fact
checking
big
Ben
be
just
the
bell
it
be
the
bell
--
part
of
the
--
so
the
tour
guide
love
it
anyway
wonder
what
other
lie
he
be
spread
well
president
Obama
have
some
new
--
we
know
he
have
executive
order
obviously
he
have
be
slam
for
he
executive
action
of
course
he
have
try
to
push
through
Congress
some
of
these
new
gun
law
new
legislation
through
Congress
on
background
check
for
those
with
--
you
know
conceal
carry
weapon
and
other
in
extreme
--
extended
background
check
for
firearm
that
do
not
happen
though
Congress
shoot
that
down
what
be
the
president
do
accord
to
politico
go
to
take
action
in
he
own
hand
yes
so
he
be
go
to
be
change
the
definition
of
what
it
mean
to
be
engage
in
business
of
firearm
sale
so
it
be
not
just
people
who
be
do
this
for
the
object
of
livelihood
and
profit
it
will
be
for
gun
seller
even
online
and
at
gun
show
too
which
be
exactly
what
we
have
come
to
expect
from
this
White
House
because
the
will
of
the
people
be
not
behind
move
congress
to
do
these
type
of
thing
he
just
take
the
power
himself
in
executive
action
and
he
do
it
through
regulation
and
definition
and
tweet
that
make
it
more
difficult
for
folk
to
sell
legally
which
currently
legally
sell
gun
and
they
will
have
to
register
now
with
the
atf
thus
more
background
check
thus
more
red
tape
and
thus
more
complication
for
the
most
part
for
legal
lawful
gun
owner
and
it
be
not
clear
that
any
of
these
regulation
would
have
stop
any
of
the
shooting
we
have
see
thus
far
no
the
big
criticism
have
be
well
we
have
this
gun
show
loophole
so
this
legislation
this
action
would
fall
short
of
that
it
would
also
increase
the
number
of
transaction
that
be
subject
to
these
background
check
put
the
onus
now
on
these
small
business
owner
to
have
to
go
and
make
sure
that
this
be
take
care
of
accord
to
politico
we
do
not
have
the
detail
just
yet
but
when
he
return
to
Washington
next
week
that
be
when
he
will
figure
out
so
if
you
be
pro-second
amendment
listen
up
and
the
fear
of
so
many
who
see
this
last
year
and
he
see
this
as
the
last
year
to
get
all
the
thing
do
that
he
have
not
do
even
if
the
american
people
and
Congress
do
not
want
it
it
be
not
just
gun
control
it
be
also
executive
action
that
he
be
likely
to
take
on
immigration
yesterday
the
president
announce
that
he
be
go
to
give
more
work
per
myth
to
foreign
college
graduate
be
not
just
what
be
exist
with
visa
he
be
go
to
expand
that
program
we
do
want
to
have
the
best
and
brightest
mind
here
in
the
United
States
to
try
compete
on
a
global
scale
but
at
the
same
time
what
be
that
go
to
do
to
the
best
and
brightest
mind
who
be
already
here
in
the
United
States
the
White
House
argue
look
Congress
have
not
take
action
on
any
of
this
they
have
sit
on
they
hand
they
have
not
do
any
of
this
so
we
need
to
do
it
ourselves
that
be
the
argument
from
the
White
House
that
be
the
argument
from
Josh
earnest
at
the
podium
that
if
Congress
be
not
go
to
do
it
then
we
be
go
to
do
it
that
be
what
the
president
say
critic
be
go
to
say
the
new
policy
create
economic
incentive
for
employer
to
hire
foreign
college
graduate
over
college
graduate
because
it
be
cheaper
to
hire
the
foreign
college
graduate
and
then
also
there
be
incentive
for
citizenship
to
that
employment
you
have
get
a
tough
economy
you
be
go
to
open
this
up
even
further
and
folk
without
a
job
who
be
underemployed
be
out
of
luck
extra
incentive
go
to
we
facebook
page
this
morning
on
this
new
year
day
be
also
the
place
you
can
e-mail
we
this
monk
come
up
on
the
show
remember
she
the
woman
who
swear
that
she
be
black
even
though
she
be
100
%
white
some
of
the
most
infamous
face
of
2015
and
we
will
look
back
at
where
they
be
and
where
they
be
now
and
it
be
pretty
clear
that
Donald
Trump
think
about
the
clinton
what
he
think
about
the
Clintons
after
this
week
she
want
to
accuse
I
of
thing
and
the
husband
be
one
of
the
great
abuser
of
the
world
give
I
a
break
be
he
latest
strategy
work
a
fair
and
balanced
debate
next
I
be
Jerry
Bell
the
second
and
I
be
Jerry
Bell
the
third
I
be
like
a
big
bear
and
he
be
my
little
cub
this
little
guy
be
non-stop
he
be
always
hang
out
with
he
friend
you
have
get
to
be
prepare
to
sit
at
the
edge
of
you
seat
and
be
ready
to
get
up
there
be
no
deep
couch
sit
it
be
definitely
not
good
for
my
back
this
be
the
part
I
really
do
not
like
right
here
what
be
that
a
package
it
be
a
swiffer
wetjet
it
almost
feel
like
it
be
move
itself
this
be
kind
of
fun
that
come
from
my
floor
eww
this
be
deep
couch
sit
deep
couch
sit
well
Donald
Trump
take
it
to
the
clinton
this
week
after
Hillary
suggest
the
billionaire
front-runner
be
sexist
Hillary
bring
up
the
whole
thing
about
sexist
and
all
I
do
be
reverse
it
on
she
she
be
get
a
major
problem
happen
to
be
right
in
she
house
so
if
she
want
to
do
that
we
be
go
to
go
right
after
the
president
the
ex-president
and
we
will
see
how
it
all
come
out
she
want
to
accuse
I
of
thing
and
the
husband
be
one
of
the
great
abuser
of
the
world
give
I
a
break
by
the
way
I
love
the
concept
I
love
love
love
have
a
woman
president
can
not
be
she
she
be
horrible
we
view
this
as
war
do
not
we
view
this
as
war
it
be
war
so
far
silence
on
the
other
end
no
response
yet
from
the
Clinton
camp
be
the
clinton
in
full
retreat
that
be
the
question
we
be
ask
this
morning
fill
out
we
political
panel
this
morning
to
discuss
that
topic
be
republican
strategist
Kathy
Lynn
Taylor
radio
show
host
Kevin
McCullough
and
Ohio
State
Senator
Capri
thank
you
all
for
join
we
this
morning
happy
new
year
Kathy
we
will
kick
it
off
be
there
a
reason
the
Clintons
be
not
respond
to
this
attack
from
Donald
well
I
think
that
when
you
best
campaign
strategy
be
silence
then
it
really
raise
a
issue
of
integrity
and
authenticity
to
you
campaign
for
sure
I
mean
if
it
be
foreign
policy
she
have
to
be
silent
Hillary
Clinton
because
of
Libya
and
Benghazi
if
it
be
health
care
or
domestic
policy
she
have
to
be
silent
because
of
she
past
with
that
now
she
have
a
problem
here
on
character
between
the
e-mail
and
bill
Clinton
dabbling
so
I
think
she
have
a
real
issue
and
silence
say
it
all
Kevin
do
you
think
that
be
what
it
be
they
do
not
know
how
to
respond
to
this
do
they
not
anticipate
Donald
Trump
come
out
of
this
this
early
if
they
do
not
that
would
be
idiotic
on
they
part
another
big
pop
culture
thing
that
happen
this
week
be
the
arraignment
and
I
think
when
you
be
look
at
apple
to
orange
or
apple
to
apple
in
that
case
you
have
get
just
a
reminder
of
everything
we
do
not
like
about
the
clinton
that
they
be
not
trustworthy
that
there
be
a
constant
kind
of
like
doublespeak
that
you
get
from
they
and
Hillary
be
already
--
that
be
she
biggest
negative
to
begin
with
people
do
not
trust
she
so
it
be
a
big
issue
Capri
how
should
the
Hillary
camp
deal
with
it
be
silence
the
way
to
go
forward
because
of
the
bind
that
they
be
in
or
do
they
need
to
start
respond
frankly
I
personally
never
think
silence
be
the
way
to
go
you
need
to
speak
up
for
yourself
you
need
to
defend
yourself
but
the
Hillary
Clinton
more
likely
than
not
be
probably
take
the
silence
not
necessarily
because
they
do
not
know
what
to
say
because
they
do
not
want
to
quote
dignify
this
debate
I
think
there
be
a
lot
of
Democrats
in
the
space
that
even
as
be
exist
in
the
sense
that
Hillary
Clinton
be
be
judge
by
the
action
of
she
husband
and
someone
would
not
be
necessarily
judge
by
the
action
of
they
wife
at
the
same
time
not
everybody
spouse
be
a
former
president
of
the
United
States
so
he
be
certainly
I
believe
fair
game
they
probably
should
speak
up
but
I
think
they
be
probably
in
retreat
because
they
do
not
want
to
dignify
--
it
be
a
interesting
point
do
you
think
it
could
engender
sympathy
for
Hillary
Clinton
no
I
think
she
benefit
from
that
the
first
time
around
she
handle
it
gracefully
she
keep
she
head
down
but
I
do
not
think
that
will
work
this
time
and
it
be
not
just
because
it
be
only
about
bill
it
be
not
it
be
also
basic
issue
about
how
she
--
I
disagree
--
per
holesy
about
woman
which
have
not
benefit
woman
at
all
name
one
major
policy
announcement
that
have
hit
home
with
the
american
people
that
Hillary
Clinton
have
make
during
this
campaign
so
far
we
can
not
and
so
--
well
no
it
be
not
--
Kevin
do
you
expect
a
different
approach
at
all
in
the
new
year
do
you
expect
they
to
roll
out
anything
--
no
I
do
disagree
with
Cathy
on
that
I
think
that
the
100
%
successful
play
that
hillary
always
play
be
be
the
victim
and
so
to
whatever
degree
she
can
be
victimize
by
Donald
brusqueness
she
be
go
to
play
that
up
it
work
in
she
senate
campaign
she
--
take
it
--
will
it
be
effective
though
I
think
it
be
effective
with
the
democratic
base
it
be
effective
with
the
democratic
base
I
do
not
know
how
effective
it
be
with
the
electorate
I
do
not
think
in
a

best
hangover
cure
to
make
sure
you

off
to
the
right
start
on
this
2016
we
call
in
the
troops
here
holy
smoke
join
we
now
be
integrative
physician
and
author
of
the
new
book
call
happy
gut
that
be
Vincent
Pedres
nutritional
Danielle
and
bartender
Pamela
Pamela
you
bring
some
green
here
be
this
a
smart
place
to
start
you
see
a
lot
of
drunk
people
some
of
they
leave
my
bar
a
few
hour
ago
the
doctor
and
I
both
agree
I
think
juice
be
a
great
way
to
go
quickly
to
get
you
replenishment
and
nutrient
and
it
be
not
go
to
be
too
abrasive
towards
you
system
after
you
have
do
some
damage
to
it
Pete
I
know
you
have
be
suffer
you
want
some
kale
bright
and
early
kale
kale
what
cause
the
hangover
we
know
the
alcohol
but
why
the
linger
effect
the
next
day
you
be
dehydrate
you
be
deplete
of
mineral
especially
magnesium
so
that
be
one
reason
that
I
bring
in
coconut
water
try
that
one
one
of
my
remedy
be
to
drink
this
as
soon
as
you
get
home
okay
so
you
can
start
rehydrate
it
be
high
in
potassium
high
in
magnesium
it
be
go
to
help
get
the
fluid
into
you
body
and
relax
you
muscle
and
--
be
that
even
better
than
straight
up
gatorade
or
powerade
I
like
to
focus
on
natural
thing
I
prefer
something
make
by
nature
than
something
that
have
be
doctor
I
have
notice
that
coconut
water
some
people
do
not
care
for
the
taste
of
it
the
one
in
the
refrigerated
section
they
must
be
fresher
or
something
because
they
taste
a
lot
sweeter
Danielle
I
have
to
ask
you
about
charcoal
Anna
say
Yuck
charcoal
how
do
it
help
we
it
help
in
that
it
help
to
bind
toxin
when
you
be
drink
alcohol
there
be
a
lot
of
by-product
and
stock
usty
associate
with
that
instead
of
the
alcohol
be
directly
absorb
into
the
bloodstream
be
the
activate
charcoal
work
like
a
magnet
and
pull
in
the
toxin
and
then
it
be
excrete
it
be
a
good
idea
to
take
the
activate
charcoal
before
you
go
out
how
do
one
take
charcoal
there
be
actual
pill
yes
pill
form
and
you
take
--
you
could
take
two
capsule
before
bed
or
actually
before
go
out
--
preemptive
yeah
exactly
you
know
all
about
preemptive
so
you
be
not
get
the
hangover
Pamela
what
do
you
do
--
you
have
preplan
how
can
you
be
smarter
so
you
do
not
do
this
the
next
time
I
call
it
the
ultimate
pregame
right
like
get
ready
to
go
out
definitely
have
you
nutrient
we
can
agree
on
that
and
also
make
sure
you
be
eat
really
well
have
a
good
substantial
meal
starch
be
really
important
as
well
as
drink
a
ton
of
water
for
every
drink
that
you
have
you
should
be
have
a
glass
of
water
you
still
will
get
intoxicated
but
you
will
not
be
deplete
yourself
of
the
hydration
my
favorite
way
to
get
rid
of
the
hangover
not
that
I
have
ever
have
one
be
to
exercise
sweat
it
out
you
can
feel
it
come
out
of
you
sometimes
can
not
you
you
think
that
be
a
smart
move
it
depend
on
how
dehydrated
you
start
you
have
to
make
sure
that
you
be
rehydrate
before
and
another
thing
I
be
go
to
say
be
do
not
drink
on
a
empty
stomach
it
be
go
to
hit
you
much
faster
Anna
say
she
favorite
recovery
be
exercise
mine
be
a
drink
little
hair
of
the

do
that
work
or
be

not
good
no
no

green

what
about

we

be
pound
coffee
this

coffee
that
be
the
first
thing
everyone

for
because
you
want
the
energy
you
want
the
jolt
the
drink
in
itself
be
dehydrate
now
you
be
have
coffee
which
be
dehydrate
and
alcohol
can
be
inflammatory
and
so
be
coffee
it
be
a
good
idea
to
go
for
green
tea
because
it
give
you
the
caffeine
it
have
antioxidant
polyphenol
flavonoid
which
combat
all
the
free
radical
damage
from

and
it
be
not

dehydrate
you
it
be
a
better
option
this
one
I
like
have
ginger
in
it
because
it
kind
of
soothe
you
stomach
also

the
Combo
between
the
green
tea
and

the
five
soldier
whose
die
in
the
flood
w
be
Alisyn
and
Chris
back
to
you
the
political
season
about
to
pick
up
speed
the
Iowa
caucus
just
one
month
away
it
will
be
the
first
time
that
we
have
real
result
from
real
voter
we
can
not
just
mindlessly
speculate
anymore
that
be
right
that
be
over
and
we
actually
have
a
real
political
panel
here
now
to
give
we
some
insight
CNN
political
commentator
and
CNN
political
commentator
Anna
Navarro
and
Jeffrey
Lord
Anna
look
into
you
crystal
ball
what
be
about
to
happen
now
oh
Lord
Alisyn
that
crystal
ball
be
so
hard
to
read
in
2015
I
be
not
sure
I
be
go
to
do
a
better
job
of
it
in
2016
but
you
be
right
we
be
in
the
sprint
I
be
very
happy
to
tell
you
we
do
have
about
two
more
week
of
mindless
speculation
leave
oh
good
you
do
know
that
Iowa
voter
New
Hampshire
voter
these
folk
just
take
they
time
they
like
to
look
under
the
hood
and
a
lot
of
they
half
of
they
do
not
make
up
they
mind
until
that
last
week
but
certainly
we
be
in
the
sprint
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
a
lot
of
candidate
spend
a
lot
of
time
some
of
they
focus
on
Iowa
some
of
they
more
focus
in
New
Hampshire
too
reasonable
let
bite
off
some
stuff
and
chew
on
it
Jeffrey
Lord
tellry
why
it
be
truer
or
false
Trump
can
not
hold
on
in
Iowa
the
evangelical
base
too
big
they
can
not
handle
it
they
go
Cruz
true
or
false
or
not
and
why
possible
possible
I
call
that
a
hedge
come
on
it
be
2015
take
a
risk
be
you
ask
I
could
Ted
Cruz
win
this
in
Iowa
yes
the
question
be
what
can
he
do
beyond
that
and
the
one
thing
I
would
add
be
Ronald
Reagan
lose
Iowa
and
become
president
Rick
Santorum
and
Huckabee
both
win
Iowa
and
never
become
president
so
win
Iowa
in
and
of
itself
do
not
do
anything
this
be
a
long
march
here
New
Hampshire
South
Carolina
and
on
beyond
that
whoever
win
even
if
Donald
Trump
win
Iowa
that
be
not
go
to
solve
anything
or
settle
anything
win
Iowa
do
not
mean
anything
it
be
always
good
to
win
Iowa
but
here
be
the
thing
Iowa
do
not
crown
a
king
but
it
knock
out
a
lot
of
princes
I
think
we
be
go
to
--
remember
how
big
this
field
be
be
go
to
get
knock
out
and
then
another
big
polling
1
or
2
%
in
the
poll
can
mean
a
lot
for
the
top
tier
candidate
after
Iowa
we
be
go
to
see
a
big
shake
up
and
start
again
it
be
good
to
win
but
it
be
not
everything
I
can
not
trust
the
next
two
with
this
next
one
so
I
will
stay
with
you
Amanda
at
the
most
recent
republican
debate
where
trump
look
at
JEB
and
say
who
be
Talken
I
or
you
Jeb
and
then
she
give
a
little
of
that
action
which
be
what
Jeb
Bush
do
and
this
be
a
new
Bush
he
be
decide
to
o
be
the
anti
trump
and
it
be
go
to
give
he
a
boost
yes
or
no
Amanda
it
be
always
good
to
see
JEB
assert
himself
on
the
national
stage
I
think
people
be
wait
for
that
and
the
less
guard
Jeb
Bush
be
the
better
it
be
for
he
that
say
I
still
think
it
be
a
bad
idea
for
Jeb
Bush
to
define
hisse
he
candidacy
via
trump
he
need
to
be
he
own
man
and
look
forward
on
the
current
fight
and
get
in
the
middle
of
that
be
that
the
moment
in
the
last
CNN
debate
where
he
find
he
sea
leg
do
he
feel
that
he
find
he
voice
that
night
you
know
I
be
see
a
different
Jeb
Bush
in
the
last
several
week
since
the
very
bad
debate
in
Boulder
I
think
that
he
figure
out
that
Thete
ricks
be
part
of
the
job
distribution
and
he
be
now
do
it
if
we
see
that
kind
of
thing
on
the
republican
or
the
Democrat
side
it
will
be
huge
but
Jeb
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
he
keep
grind
away
a
lot
of
retail
politics
spending
time
in
the
early
state
New
Hampshire
and
South
Carolina
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
he
do
this
the
old
fashion
way
one
voter
at
a
time
Amanda
one
thing
about
that
the
interesting
part
about
the
new
JEB
dynamic
be
a
rise
JEB
and
a
rise
Chris
Christie
make
life
a
lot
harder
for
Marco
Rubio
in
many
way
they
be
compete
for
the
same
type
of
voter
and
the
more
they
clash
the
more
those
three
continue
to
be
competitive
with
each
other
make
it
easier
for
Cruz
or
trump
to
take
the
bigger
lane
actually
I
think
it
be
the
two
young
buck
that
have
be
lock
horn
and
I
think
we
be
go
to
continue
see
Cruz
and
Rubio
who
be
so
evenly
match
and
both
rookie
senator
both
lawyer
very
different
style
one
be
poetic
and
the
other
go
legalese
on
we
and
I
think
you
be
go
to
see
the
two
of
they
clash
a
lot
which
I
be
not
sure
do
not
open
a
space
for
another
candidate
maybe
jeffreys
maybe
somebody
else
what
about
this
one
the
chance
that
Donald
Trump
pick
a
female
run
meat
before
the
convention
before
the
convention
yes
possible
yeah
sure
I
can
see
it
possible
it
be
possible
that
Alisyn
knock
I
unconscious
in
the
next
15
seconds
--
I
think
sure
absolutely
I
mean
if
Donald
Trump
win
this
nomination
or
it
become
certain
ahead
of
time
that
he
be
go
to
do
it
yeah
yes
that
be
possible
he
could
pick
Carly
Fiorina
he
could
pick
Ted
Cruz
oh
come
on
he
can
not
stand
Carly
Fiorina
he
be
say
over
and
over
again
that
five
minute
of
--
but
--
-lsb-
inaudible
-rsb-
JFK
could
not
stand
Linden
Johnson
either
but
he
make
he
vice
president
Donald
Trump
be
no
jfk
there
be
one
other
thing
here
I
really
think
this
be
go
to
be
the
year
of
the
outsider
again
election
year
itself
so
whether
it
be
Donald
Trump
or
ted
Cruz
or
whomever
I
think
the
outside
be
win
I
think
that
be
why
Donald
Trump
pick
on
Jeb
Bush
all
the
time
not
because
he
think
Jeb
Bush
be
a
threat
but
because
Jeb
Bush
be
the
very
symbol
of
the
establishment
and
whether
it
be
Jeb
Bush
or
John
Kasich
or
some
of
the
other
I
think
that
be
a
real
weakness
and
I
think
somebody
on
the
outside
be
go
to
win
this
nomination
I
think
we
be
go
to
leave
it
there
absolutely
Jeffrey
happy
new
year
the
evolve
threat
from
Isis
grow
deadlier
Downing
a
passenger
plane
in
Egypt
attack
in
Paris
inspiring
the
first
deadly
attack
here
at
home
we
be
go
discuss
ahead
some
call
it
give
back
we
call
it
share
the
love
during
we
share
the
love
event
get
a
new
Subaru
and
we
will
donate
$
250
to
those
in
need
bring
we
total
donation
to
over
sixty-five
million
dollar
and
bring
love
where
it
be
need
most
love
it
be
what
make
a
Subaru
a
Subaru
try
the
superior
hold
of
fixodent

they
help
you
denture

and
you
can
eat
even
tough
food
fixodent
strong
more
like
natural
tooth
fixodent
and
forget
it
now
in
2015
the
number
of
refugee
flee
war
tear
country
like
Syria
reach
the
level
of
international
crisis
thousand
die
make
dangerous
journey
toe
scape
turmoil
at
home
million
more
have
nowhere
to
go
will
there
be
a
solution
what
be
go
to
happen
in
Syria
what
be
go
to
happen
with
daesh
what
will
the
new
year
bring
happen
new
year
Sir
wish
you
all
the
best
always
let
take
a
look
binto
the
bal
we
have
a
unreasonable
expectation
of
speed
when
it
come
to
deal
with
terror
or
isil
or
daesh
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
how
do
you
seal
deal
with
Isis
this
year
I
think
you
will
have
to
call
I
skeptical
it
be
good
thing
that
all
the
different
negotiation
be
take
place
and
all
the
different
foreign
player
be
try
to
reach
settlement
but
I
be
not
very
optimistic
that
be
go
to
go
very
far
all
the
outside
state
none
of
these
country
seem
to
agree
on
the
basics
who
be
the
bad
guy
who
be
the
good
guy
can
Assad
stay
some
say
yes
some
never
so
because
these
other
group
can
not
aware
at
a
common
idea
of
what
progress
look
like
any
negotiation
towards
unless
you
have
the
real
framework
conversation
be
not
go
to
go
anywhere
o
do
you
see
a
massive
deployment
of
troops
on
the
ground
I
do
not
see
that
happen
unless
a
major
event
in
the
United
States
I
think
public
opinion
in
the
United
States
will
remain
strongly
oppose
to
put
boot
on
the
ground
and
no
american
president
especially
not
a
lame
duck
one
let
be
not
forget
be
go
to
be
able
to
persuade
the
american
people
that
we
need
to
put
american
boot
on
the
ground
so
absent
and
let
hope
that
never
happen
absent
a
major
event
against
a
american
target
I
do
not
see
american
soldier
go
--
be
2016
the
year
Islam
take
on
the
skorj
of
islamist
extremist
in
its
own
faith
do
you
think
we
will
see
it
on
the
state
level
and
the
popular
level
against
the
enemy
I
would
argue
that
be
already
go
on
it
will
continue
to
take
place
there
be
conversation
take
place
among
muslim
scholar
how
to
deal
with
this
and
there
be
a
number
of
conversation
take
place
the
community
be
already
grapple
with
this
I
do
not
think
they
need
a
major
event
or
a
major
calendar
event
to
take
place
for
they
to
accelerate
but
you
do
not
have
a
massive
army
let
say
Saudi
Arabia
you
could
go
either
way
but
Turkey
you
do
not
have
they
say
this
be
we
fight
you
can
help
we
give
we
money
and
--
but
I
do
not
think
that
be
a
realistic
expectation
because
the
enemy
be
not
a
traditional
nation
state
even
though
Isis
control
territory
it
be
not
as
if
a
muslim
country
be
say
we
be
go
to
go
there
and
fight
those
people
these
guy
be
everywhere
Turkey
they
be
deal
with
extremism
within
they
own
country
Isis
be
already
you
know
interest
be
land
fall
in
Turkey
I
would
pay
less
attention
to
political
leader
in
the
world
and
more
attention
to
civil
group
political
activist
religious
figure
and
if
you
focus
you
attention
there
you
will
see
there
be
a
lot
of
struggle
already
go
on
about
how
to
deal
with
extremism
in
we
midst
politician
have
get
different
agenda
to
deal
with
and
sometimes
they
be
contradictory
to
what
we
would
like
they
to
be
do
but
in
ordinary
civil
society
there
be
a
lot
take
place
that
be
room
for
optimism
so
we
have
a
lot
of
time
before
we
be
go
to
see
real
change
on
the
ground
any
chance
of
a
new
look
from
Bobby
Ghosh
in
2016
not
that
this
be
not
be
not
killer
but
be
there
any
chance
you
be
go
to
Grouf
out
the
hair
again
that
be
a
long
time
ago
the
world
do
not
need
to
see
that
it
be
a
successful
look
everybody
love
you
Bobby
Ghosh
thank
you
very
much
always

that
be
a
look
at
you
new

morning
headline
Alisyn
and
crazy
Chris
back
to
you
so
at
the
stroke
of
Minnesota
it
officially
become
a
election
year
congratulation
feel
good
all
eye
on
the
presidential
race
but
there
be
plenty
of
key
congressional
race
to
watch
as
well
how
will
Donald
Trump
rise
effect
the
republican
reign
in
both
house
of
Congress
here
to
illustrate
it
all
be
CNN
chief
national
correspondent
John
King
happy
new
year
John
I
be
go
to
take
a
vacation
can
I
have
all
year
off
no
this
be
go
to
be
a
busy
year
fur
you
let
start
right
now
what
do
you
predict
the
trump
effect
will
be
not
just
on
the
presidential
race
but
all
the
other
congressional
race
it
will
be
easier
in
March
or
April
after
the
primary
but
there
be
no
question
republican
be
worried
and
democrat
be
happy
right
now
you
hear
Hillary
Clinton
and
Bernie
Sanders
say
all
republican
be
antimuslim
all
republican
be
the
antiafrican
american
all
republican
be
the
antiimmigrant
and
antihispanic
they
be
paint
the
Republican
party
with
the
trump
brush
and
worried
that
some
race
that
be
lean
Republican
right
now
could
go
democratic
if
trump
stay
in
the
headline
if
trump
be
the
nominee
they
be
even
more
worried
thaw
they
do
think
it
be
a
factor
how
big
ask
I
in
March
April
May
a
little
of
what
be
go
on
though
be
in-house
disorder
right
the
GOP
have
make
big
gain
since
Obama
have
be
the
president
of
the
United
States
and
maybe
there
be
a
feeling
within
the
party
they
do
not
get
what
they
be
bargaining
for
in
term
of
this
big
movement
from
blue
to
red
across
the
map
you
can
show
we
and
yet
they
feel
they
do
not
have
anything
to
show
for
that
so
they
be
angry
at
they
own
party
that
be
right
look
at
the
house
map
here
this
be
the
United
States
of
America
247
House
district
a
big
majority
and
Republicans
remember
this
because
let
go
back
to
right
after
Obama
be
elect
the
Democrat
have
the
majority
in
2007
this
be
after
the
election
in
2008
2012
Democrats
get
a
little
back
not
a
big
sweep
in
the
second
term
only
eight
seat
for
the
Democrats
then
2014
wow
boom
and
a
lot
of
people
on
the
coast
which
be
blue
tend
to
forget
this
but
America
be
very
red
and
that
be
why
the
republican
base
be
upset
they
have
this
house
majority
and
then
they
win
the
Senate
majority
in
the
midterm
election
last
time
and
they
do
not
think
they
be
get
much
for
it
that
be
why
you
have
trump
and
outsider
talk
to
the
republican
base
say
why
do
we
keep
win
but
not
get
what
we
want
and
that
be
a
big
part
of
the
dynamic
there
be
four
seat
I
guess
the
Democrats
could
retake
there
be
more
than
that
but
first
just
look
at
it
34
Senate
race
up
a
third
be
up
every
cycle
and
all
the
red
republican
be
defend
24
seat
Democrats
have
ten
seat
to
defend
part
depend
on
the
sweep
of
the
presidential
election
you
have
to
call
that
a
toss
up
right
now
she
be
run
for
reelection
Democrats
tend
to
win
that
state
and
presidential
politics
Florida
Marco
Rubio
seat
he
be
not
run
for
reelection
that
be
a
toss
up
one
democratic
toss
up
Harry
Reed
the
latino
vote
the
presidential
election
will
influence
Florida
and
Nevada
and
the
presidential
election
will
no
doubt
influence
New
Hampshire
those
be
you
toss
up
and
then
you
look
at
other
race
this
be
why
the
trump
effect
could
come
in
in
Pennsylvania
have
go
blue
and
presidential
politics
back
to
1988
a
republican
incumbent
running
in
that
state
not
a
strong
democratic
challenger
at
the
moment
but
Republicans
worry
if
you
have
a
big
democratic
surge
they
could
lose
that
one
Ohio
Rob
Portman
you
would
have
to
say
portman
should
be
the
incumbent
go
in
but
Ohio
can
go
back
and
forth
in
presidential
politics
Ron
Johnson
in
Wisconsin
go
to
run
most
likely
against
former
senator
rus
fine
goeld
again
a
state
that
tend
to
go
blue
in
politics
so
if
you
have
a
15
%
majority
and
I
give
you
--
Republicans
be
simply
worry
in
a
big
democratic
presidential
year
we
could
lose
that
could
have
a
seven
or
eight
seat
swing
that
be
why
they
want
to
be
guard
about
and
why
we
be
have
the
debate
in
Vegas
Nevada
of
grow
importance
in
the
election
Harry
Reed
be
retire
in
Nevada
Republicans
should
be
able
to
win
that
one
except
you
be
dead
right
Chris
Nevada
and
New
Mexico
use
to
be
swing
state
in
presidential
politics
they
use
to
go
back
and
forth
now
you
have
to
say
they
lean
democratic
if
they
be
not
just
blue
because
of
the
republican
failure
McCain
and
Romney
to
get
the
latino
vote
watch
what
happen
as
we
go
through
this
year
but
at
the
moment
especially
with
the
trump
effect
Republicans
be
very
nervous
they
have
a
strong
candidate
for
the
Senate
seat
but
they
be
nervous
for
a
presidential
year
they
get
overwhelm
by
a
wave
what
happen
to
all
of
that
momentum
if
you
look
at
the
datum
Donald
Trump
be
a
third
party
candidate
t
datum
today
as
we
enter
the
year
and
if
we
learn
anything
in
2015
we
should
remember
in
2016
that
thing
change
Donald
Trump
as
the
third
party
candidate
hurt
the
Republican
Party
and
almost
guarantee
a
democratic
victory
if
people
come
out
to
vote
for
trump
as
a
independent
should
he
do
that
they
be
still
go
to
vote
for
House
and
Senate
and
they
choice
in
almost
all
of
those
race
be
d
or
but
that
be
a
potential
wild
card
especially
when
it
come
to
turn
out
operation
you
also
say
hey
vote
for
Senate
but
the
trump
factor
there
become
pretty
strange
so
what
do
you
have
what
be
go
to
be
he
spirit
animal
the
Teddy
Bear
what
do
you
see
John
King
well
he
be
the
human
chain
saw
how
do
you
attach
a
animal
to
that
some
kind
lion
I
be
go
with
a
liger
a
happy
new
year
seem
more
like
a
purist
so
I
so
we
be
look
at
politics
we
be
also
look
at
money
it
have
be
a
bumpy
ride
in
2015
rise
and
fall
market
what
can
we
expect
in
the
new

the
financial

we
should
all
make
now
come

a
healthier

this
year
join

about
we
financial
health
join
we
we
chef
of

chief
business
correspondent
Christine
Romans
First
of
all
happy
new
year
and
I
think
this
be
such
ab
a
important
for
thing
we
to
talk
about
all
these
resolution
and
we
often
say
I
want
to
lower
my
credit
card
debt
and
spend
less
money
but
there
be
more
involved
thing
we
can
be
aware
of
and
you
be
go
to
walk
we
through
some
of
those
resolution
we
need
to
be
make
absolutely
it
be
a
new
year
new
year
and
you
birthday
be
two
time
you
really
look
at
you
money
two
time
a
year
mortgage
rate
here
what
be
we
predict
be
go
to
happen
especially
for
those
maybe
thinking
of
buy
a
home
refie
any
of
that
mortgage
rate
and
interest
rate
be
rise
and
that
be
true
but
I
still
think
they
be
go
to
rise
very
slowly
and
be
well
below
historical
average
so
as
the
nice
time
to
buy
a
home
if
you
want
to
refinance
that
could
be
the
biggest
money-saving
thing
you
do
all
year
many
have
already
do
that
a
couple
of
time
hello
$
400
save
per
month
and
that
be
something
we
should
be
think
about
too
there
be
go
to
be
more
market
volatility
and
saving
could
be
important
this
year
market
volatility
and
some
of
rus
a
little
shy
and
look
at
we
personal
finances
in
a
different
way
which
bring
I
to
gas
price
we
have
see
some
low
do
you
think
they
be
go
to
stay
I
think
you
can
look
at
that
money
not
just
fall
into
something
else
I
think
it
be
really
important
to
take
those
savings
and
build
you
cash
reserve
make
sure
you
have
3-6
month
of
money
on
hand
for
a
emergency
and
really
take
a
look
at
use
that
little
bit
of
extra
in
you
monthly
budget
to
pay
down
■
highinterest
credit
card
debt
and
get
out
of
debt
and
start
save
and
move
forward
and
it
be
important
to
get
out
of
debt
before
interest
rate
do
rise
because
then
the
cost
become
so
much
higher
but
I
agree
I
think
oil
be
go
to
be
around
$
50
a
barrel
this
year
because
OPEC
be
co-n
ting
to
pump
a
lot
iranian
oil
and
still
the
shale
boom
at
home
all
that
news
for
we
personal
economy
do
not
necessarily
mean
great
news
for
the
energy
sector
no
and
it
do
not
necessarily
mean
good
news
for
investor
because
of
the
volatility
in
stock
market
and
the
global
demand
be
week
weak
the
be
raise
and
some
country
no
or
negative
interest
rate
so
I
do
not
think
you
should
expect
to
see
big
gain
in
the
stock
market
this
year
in
the
stock
market
portfolio
it
be
incredibly
important
to
be
dollar
cost
averaging
buy
stock
every
month
periodly
know
what
you
mix
be
for
you
risk
and
how
long
you
have
to
retire
and
put
money
into
a
529
for
you
kid
college
tuition
be
go
occupy
so
invest
for
you
child
education
too
and
even
though
the
market
be
not
go
to
two
up
the
blue
chip
be
still
a
great
place
just
because
we
be
not
go
to
get
the
return
maybe
of
the
past
we
be
still
sort
of
the
pretty
house
on
the
ugly
block
have
the
global
economy
we
have
the
time
to
ask
you
this
look
forward
for
the
other
there
be
probably
a
couple
of
people
just
start
out
and
think
okay
I
know
I
be
hear
my
parent
tell
my
e
need
to
get
into
the
market
it
can
be
very
very
overwhelming
what
be
the
best
piece
of
advice
for
someone
absolutely
do
it
particularly
--
it
be
terrifying
though
when
you
see
the
volatility
take
the
long
view
if
you
be
a
young
person
--
there
be
room
sure
there
be
room
for
change
and
there
be
go
to
be
volatility
this
year
no
question
but
do
not
sell
when
the
market
go
down
Hang
tight
everybody
panic
it
be
we
psychology
but
you
get
hang
tight
and
weather
the
storm
there
be
two
kind
of
people
the
kind
who
think
about
how
they
be
go
to
spend
they
money
and
the
kind
who
think
about
how
they
be
go
to
grow
they
money
and
you
want
to
be
the
kind
of
person
who
be
grow
you
money
you
want
to
make
sure
you
be
live
on
a
little
less
than
you
bring
home
every
month
and
the
rest
you
be
invest
and
you
do
that
in
the
stock
market
and
do
that
with
voesmt
investment
they
have
be
over
the
past
six
year
able
to
grow
household
net
worth
because
wages
be
not
do
it
and
for
those
that
it
can
and
give
the
volatility
and
that
some
sector
be
go
the
feel
they
own
volatility
the
emergency
fund
I
think
this
be
something
you
teach
I
a
lot
about
be
have
that
little
extra
cushion
what
be
the
best
way
to
start
that
it
have
to
be
automatic
you
have
to
take
it
out
of
you
paycheck
you
have
to
almost
not
see
that
money
and
it
be
so
important
because
about
half
of
all
american
can
not
put
they
hand
on
even
dollar
if
they
need
in
a
emergency
you
have
to
have
that
savings
a
lot
of
people
be
one
flat
tire
away
from
ruin
they
budget
you
need
a
little
put
away
but
you
need
to
get
out
of
credit
card
debt
credit
card
debt
be
the
worst
thing
and
you
have
to
get
out
of
debt
for
young
people
with
student
loan
ten
year
you
get
to
pay
it
off
in
ten
year
a
lot
of
kid
be
try
to
get
out
in
under
five
year
because
they
want
to
be
part
of
the
middle
class
we
give

happy
new
year
to
both
of
you
gentleman
you
be
a
very
interesting
pairing
on
this
topic
let
start
with
the
common
ground
you
come
from
similar
position
in
term
of
you
family
use
gun
you
be
from
hunting
family
you
know
how
to
use
gun
you
shoot
gun
yet
you
be
on
different
side
of
the
gun
control
issue
Charles
start
with
you
what
do
you
think
lawmaker
plan
to
do
about
gun
control
in
the
coming
year
I
do
not
think
there
be
necessarily
a
plan
and
I
do
not
think
there
be
necessarily
go
to
be
a
lot
of
progress
what
end
up
happen
be
the
debate
run
up
against
the
constitutional
structure
of
the
country
the
gun
debate
overlap
with
wide
open
space
in
the
country
and
people
who
want
more
regulation
be
generally
in
the
cluster
urban
space
but
because
of
the
way
the
Senate
be
structure
every
state
no
matter
how
wide
open
how
few
people
be
in
that
state
still
have
two
senator
Brooklyn
have
more
population
than
all
of
Alaska
but
New
York
state
be
only
go
to
have
two
senator
just
like
Alaska
have
two
senator
so
when
you
get
down
to
vote
on
a
actual
kind
of
more
regulation
the
people
in
Alaska
who
be
more
hunting
culture
be
go
to
say
those
center
will
say
my
constituent
do
not
necessarily
want
this
so
I
be
not
go
to
support
this
and
that
be
why
it
be
be
such
a
challenge
in
Congress
to
see
any
sort
of
action
but
then
president
Obama
say
after
the
tragedy
in
newtown
he
could
do
what
he
could
and
sound
like
he
be
eye
executive
action
on
gun
control
I
think
you
will
see
a
lot
of
executive
action
especially
closer
to
the
end
of
he
presidency
and
something
he
want
to
be
a
part
of
he
legacy
but
if
they
really
want
to
get
something
do
on
Capitol
Hill
I
think
there
be
thing
Charles
and
I
and
other
can
agree
on
and
that
be
probably
take
smaller
step
to
deal
with
specific
issue
one
of
those
would
be
mental
health
I
think
there
be
bipartisan
support
that
can
be
find
on
deal
with
mental
health
and
what
we
should
do
with
mental
health
when
it
come
to
buy
a
gun
or
not
be
able
to
purchase
one
if
you
be
commit
against
you
will
by
a
state
or
by
a
judge
those
be
type
of
thing
I
think
Congress
could
have
success
on
if
they
try
to
turn
it
into
a
massive
gun
control
law
it
will
not
pass
there
be
not
the
vote
there
if
you
have
leadership
here
and
focus
on
simple
issue
where
you
can
find
the
common
ground
I
actually
think
they
could
probably
get
something
do
most
Americans
would
support
how
about
that
point
of
compromise
everybody
after
Newtown
and
after
the
Aurora
movie
theater
say
we
need
the
mental
health
gun
nexus
to
be
deal
with
somehow
I
do
believe
there
be
a
mental
health
component
but
I
do
not
think
that
you
can
necessarily
take
on
mental
health
without
deal
with
the
40
%
of
transfer
of
weapon
that
require
no
background
check
whatsoever
he
be
say
baby
step
right
but
I
be
say
40
%
transfer
that
do
not
require
any
check
that
be
go
to
be
really
hard
to
deal
with
the
mental
health
piece
because
it
be
only
deal
with
the
6
%
that
do
require
some
sort
of
background
check
you
have
to
combine
a
couple
of
these
in
order
to
make
they
actual
work
excellent
point
so
tackle
that
the
gun
show
loophole
as
it
be
call
means
there
be
private
transfer
that
do
not
have
to
be
record
there
be
no
background
check
so
with
mental
health
how
be
you
go
to
tackle
that
when
it
come
to
private
deal
if
you
come
at
this
from
a
sensible
solution
which
be
hey
if
I
be
buy
a
gun
from
my
dad
in
law
enforcement
and
we
have
trade
gun
multiple
time
since
I
have
be
a
young
adult
that
be
a
example
of
where
you
have
a
caveat
for
that
I
think
you
can
find
some
common
ground
there
be
many
people
who
say
if
I
be
trade
a
gun
with
my
neighbor
or
with
a
hunting
buddy
who
say
would
really
love
that
and
let
do
a
trade
that
be
where
you
have
something
like
that
that
do
take
place
a
lot
there
be
a
lot
of
people
in
hunting
club
for
example
that
have
club
gun
where
somebody
want
to
go
use
and
it
they
trade
with
another
person
that
happen
all
the
time
why
be
that
paperwork
so
onerous
to
ask
you
just
to
record
that
transaction
it
be
onerous
because
you
have
to
go
through
a
licensed
arm
dealer
you
have
to
then
pay
another
fee
on
top
of
it
depend
on
the
class
of
firearm
it
can
be
extremely
expensive
and
in
some
case
you
have
to
even
set
up
a
trust
and
have
each
person
use
that
gun
on
a
trust
when
you
look
at
the
paperwork
I
would
point
to
the
federal
government
they
have
make
it
so
hard
to
do
these
thing
if
they
would
streamline
the
process
I
think
you
would
have
a
lot
of
people
that
would
agree
on
it
but
I
think
even
you
know
more
common
than
even
maybe
gun
show
and
more
common
than
hunting
club
be
intergenerational
transfer
you
have
a
grandfather
he
be
holder
do
not
hunt
anymore
we
have
gun
my
whole
life
I
and
my
brother
and
other
than
the
bee
bee
gun
and
belt
gun
we
never
buy
the
real
gun
there
be
a
grandfather
t
uncle
so
lawmaker
do
not
need
to
tackle
that
part
--
what
I
be
say
be
just
because
the
father
or
grandfather
be
a
responsible
gun
owner
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
person
they
be
pass
it
down
too
I
believe
that
transfer
need
to
be
record
and
there
have
to
be
some
check
on
the
mental
stability
and
criminal
background
of
the
person
who
be
come
into
possession
of
that
gun
right
now
that
be
not
necessarily
the
case
and
I
think
that
that
become
a
loophole
that
get
fuzzy
mfor
people
because
we
want
to
say
it
be
in
my
family
I
should
be
able
to
do
whatever
I
want
to
within
my
family
many
people
be
go
to
say
this
it
be
not
a
loophole
because
lar
law
that
say
if
you
be
a
convict
felon
you
be
not
allow
to
own
a
firearm
whether
it
be
give
to
you
or
not
sure
but
if
you
be
not
a
convict
felon
if
you
have
maybe
some
mental
instability
that
become
a
issue
and
many
of
we
shooter
be
not
convict
felon
and
if
we
can
just
focus
first
off
on
the
mental
health
side
of
this
and
build
momentum
from
it
there
also
be
a
big
trust
issue
here
you
have
people
on
both
side
who
do
not
trust
the
other
side
and
they
think
they
be
always
go
to
go
for
something
a
step
further
if
they
can
just
focus
on
one
piece
at
a
time
that
could
be
where
we
could
actually
be
have
conversation
next
new
year
about
wow
we
do
some
good
this
year
and
it
make
sense
otherwise
we
be
not
go
to
get
anything
do
at
all
Ben
Charles

much
at
least

small
point

how
democratic
presidential
candidate
Bernie
Sanders
have
be
fly
coach
well
many
of
you
will
not
be
see
he
on
plane
anymore
that
be
because
sanders
change
he
routine
and
he
be
be
fly
almost
exclusively
on
private
chartered
plane
Sanders
who
often
speak
passionately
about
environmental
issue
say
take
private
jet
across
the
country
be
the
best
way
that
they
can
do
it
and
those
be
you
headline
back
to
you
guy
the
winter
classic
also
up
in
foxborough
so
they
be
play
hockey
outside
yeah
very
cool
in
Minnesota
too
do
they
still
get
in
fight
go
in
the
penalty
box
Ed
Henry
big
hockey
fan
and
we
think
he
be
not
work
enough
lately
so
we
decide
to
bring
he
in
on
new
year
day
nice
to
see
you
ed
I
just
never
go
to
bed
happy
new
year
Ed
one
of
the
hardest-working
man
in
television
cover
everything
politics
we
want
to
welcome
in
the
new
year
by
have
you
dive
in
to
some
of
the
new
executive
action
yeah
well
I
mean
look
the
president
say
that
in
he
weekly
address
here
over
the
holiday
they
put
it
out
a
little
early
usually
come
out
on
Saturday
say
there
be
more
gun
control
measure
come
he
obviously
call
they
gun
safety
we
have
be
through
the
language
before
but
I
think
the
point
be
he
be
say
he
be
not
go
to
wait
around
for
Congress
and
there
be
a
lot
of
Republicans
frustrate
with
these
executive
action
but
it
be
go
to
take
gop
leader
on
the
hill
figure
out
how
they
be
go
to
stop
piece
of
he
agenda
or
how
they
be
go
to
move
forward
on
other
piece
of
the
agenda
otherwise
he
be
just
go
to
keep
go
forward
with
these
executive
action
remember
about
a
year
ago
the
president
say
I
be
enter
the
fourth
quarter
big
thing
happen
in
the
fourth
quarter
I
be
ready
to
go
and
republican
leader
be
talk
about
repeal
obamacare
stop
he
executive
action
on
immigration
and
they
do
little
or
none
of
that
and
so
the
president
have
a
pretty
good
year
and
so
basically
I
think
the
feeling
inside
the
White
House
when
you
talk
to
he
top
aide
they
be
ready
to
keep
go
until
the
Republicans
stop
they
so
gun
control
next
week
and
there
be
more
immigration
executive
action
come
as
well
specifics
on
the
gun
control
legislation
obviously
this
do
not
close
the
gun
show
loophole
which
they
have
be
push
for
right
it
be
a
number
of
smaller
thing
take
we
through
some
of
the
process
here
on
this
new
gun
control
legislation
they
want
to
target
gun
seller
find
area
where
you
can
move
forward
on
executive
action
you
be
right
about
not
be
able
to
close
something
bigger
like
the
so-called
gun
show
loophole
we
have
hear
all
these
different
thing
that
have
come
up
because
the
president
make
the
point
again
and
again
that
would
actually
take
a
law
and
again
that
get
back
to
republican
on
the
hill
decide
that
might
be
something
obviously
they
do
not
want
to
do
but
there
be
go
to
be
other
thing
Republicans
run
the
House
and
the
Senate
they
have
for
about
a
year
now
and
so
this
be
year
two
and
so
for
Mitch
McConnell
and
Speaker
Ryan
this
be
a
big
year
for
they
head
into
a
presidential
election
so
see
what
can
they
actually
get
do
so
republicans
can
take
that
to
the
voter
you
know
whereas
obviously
Hillary
Clinton
be
clock
look
to
work
hand
in
hand
with
this
president
kind
of
change
the
definition
do
verbal
gymnastics
there
in
order
to
tweak
what
many
would
say
be
the
second
amendment
and
the
right
that
Americans
have
to
arm
themselves
next
up
this
big
document
dump
that
we
have
yesterday
the
State
Department
release
page
of
e-mail
for
Hillary
Clinton
I
want
to
know
what
stand
out
to
you
the
number
of
classified
e-mail
be
now
up
over
do
any
of
these
stick
out
to
you
yeah
there
be
some
big
picture
we
should
not
forget
that
you
be
right
now
when
you
add
up
all
of
these
various
document
dump
out
there
over
the
last
few
month
there
be
more
than
that
have
some
kind
of
information
that
the
State
Department
announce
as
classify
obviously
the
Clinton
campaign
defense
have
be
that
they
be
not
marked
classify
at
the
time
there
be
a
lot
of
back
and
forth
about
that
but
I
think
the
very
bottom
line
go
into
the
new
year
be
that
Hillary
Clinton
be
still
under
FBI
investigation
and
that
be
one
of
the
great
unknown
in
this
campaign
be
they
go
to
do
anything
about
that
server
if
they
do
not
obviously
she
be
go
to
get
a
head
of
steam
and
try
to
turn
the
page
on
all
of
this
what
stand
out
I
mean
a
couple
thing
number
one
there
be
more
e-mail
from
Sidney
Blumenthal
she
controversial
adviser
and
some
of
they
Hillary
Clinton
be
say
give
I
more
information
on
that
what
else
do
you
know
on
that
I
be
at
a
news
conference
with
Hillary
Clinton
a
couple

side
of

the
tower
inferno
that
be
burn
for
hour
and
then
on
the
other
side
the
show
go
on
as
plan
the
huge
firework
celebration
talk
about
a
juxtaposition
quite
a
contrast
first
take
a
look
from
the
video
that
we
get
earlier
today
of
today
aftermath
the
still
smolder
address
hotel
in
downtown
Dubai
it
be
a
luxury
five
star
hotel
it
also
have
apartment
inside
now
official
say
the
fire
start
about
last
night
on
a
20th
floor
terrace
of
the
63
story
tower
there
be
report
that
maybe
curtain
catch
on
fire
start
inside
one
of
the
room
but
that
be
unconfirmed
and
really
there
be
still
no
official
word
on
the
cause
I
know
what
everybody
thinking
be
this
be
terrorist
related
incident
well
there
be
nothing
to
indicate
this
be
at
all
link
to
any
type
of
terrorist
activity
that
say
though
witness
say
once
the
fire
start
it
spread
very
quickly
engulf
the
whole
side
of
the
building
incredibly
only
16
people
be
injure
14
with
minor
injury
one
person
moderately
injure
and
then
official
say
another
person
have
a
heart
attack
during
the
evacuation
process
and
we
be
hear
the
story
about
exactly
that
one

say
he
strap
he
mom
he
disabled
mother
to
he
back
other
say
they
be
scramble
to
get
out
and
despite
the
initial
panic
many
say
include
those
last
night
say
that
it
be
a
orderly
evacuation
process
really
credit
emergency
worker

point
just
remove
yourself
from
the
danger
and
regroup
for
there
to
be
no
fatality
there
be
absolutely
a
miracle
and
some
people
be

a
contrast
on

thanks
lea
all
right
well
as
you
be
think
about
you
new
year
resolution
there
be
one
that
you
may
want
to
consider
give
up
that
be
coffee
but
maybe
you
should
not
no
not
go
to
happen
we
have
the
great
news
for
all
of
we
early
riser
nice
to
see
you
happy
new
year
so
coffee
a
great
thing
you
know
what
accord
to
many
study
not
just
one
that
be
what
they
be
say
specifically
start
with
diabetes
so
there
be
28
combined
study
three
of
which
come
out
of
Harvard
University
which
be
large
study
analyze
about
a
million
people
and
they
show
that
there
be
a
inverse
correlation
between
drinking
about
three
cup
of
coffee
a
day
not
one
but
three
decrease
you
chance
of
get
diabetes
type
ii
diabetes
why
the
recent
be
chlorogenic
acid
it
be
go
to
increase
insulin
sensitivity
so
type
ii
diabetes
be
insulin
resistance
it
can
protect
we
from
liver
cancer
too
that
be
true
a
14
%
reduction
accord
to
various
study
from
something
call
Castol
it
be
go
to
decrease
liver
toxin
in
you
liver
and
thus
prevent
carcinogen
from
farm
this
be
the
subject
this
morning
validate
my
coffee
addiction
but
especially
for
man
sound
like
it
also
will
prevent
prostate
cancer
correct
accord
to
a
analysis
a
fairly
large
study
of
over
man
it
show
there
be
a
decrease
correlation
again
between
drinking
daily
cup
of
coffee
and
decrease
prostate
cancer
even
up
the
ante
if
you
have
more
than
two
cup
a
day
to
about
12
%
or
13
%
reduction
in
prostate
cancer
that
be
from
antioxidant
and
again
the
coloro
genic
acid
eight
cup
make
you
bulletroof
you
start
shake
you
next
point
about
Parkinson
disease
how
do
it
--
you
say
it
help
prevent
that
you
know
what
be
funny
it
be
kind
of
counterintuitive
but
it
be
the
caffeine
in
coffee
that
help
with
Parkinson
disease
that
be
because
it
be
go
to
block
the
receptor
in
the
brain
which
will
then
thus
increase
the
opening
so
Parkinson
by
definition
be
a
shortage
of
dopamine
so
this
be
go
to
increase
the
dopamine
I
will
not
stop
Parkinson
from
form
or
develop
however
it
be
show
to
decrease
the
symptom
which
be
imbalance
muscle
weakness
stiffness
that
kind
of
thing
we
should
be
clear
we
be
talk
about
drinking
black
coffee
like
the
way
nature
intend
it
no
Anna
drink
it
--
--
milk
--
a
flash
with
a
little
milk
be
okay
be
there
any
downside
to
it
they
be
not
find
it
in
these
study
check
with
you
primary
care
there
be
some
medication
that
be
counter
--
or
interact
with
it
it
be
always
best
to
check
with
you
primary
care
physician
on
that
one
they
can
even
make
we
liver
longer
correct
it
can
prevent
premature
death
out
of
all
the
reason
we
just
suggest
but
there
be
a
decrease
in
heart
disease
and
chronic
respiratory
disease
and
influenza
and
pneumonia
as
well
do
you
see
any
down
side
America
go
out
get
another
cup
of
coffee
if
it
be
you
first
second
third
or
fourth
and
get
on
with
you
life
of
course
you
know
--
a
little
bit
of
shake
here
and
there
but
you
know
maybe
more
than
three
minor
keep
I

Clayton
all
right
thank
you
well
it
be
a
race
to
get
the
millennial
vote
since
Bernie
Sanders
seem
to
be
the
preference
Hillary
Clinton
be
try
really
hard
to
win
they
over
just
finish
have
a
question
and
answer
with
secretary
Clinton
the
democratic
front-runner
will
not
come
on
Fox
Friends
but
she
will
let
Youtube
Star
glozell
interview
she
yeah
she
be
get
the
lady
who
get
she
fame
from
eat
cereal
in
a
bathtub
hmm
delicious
I
will
swim
in
it
Clinton
be
also
set
to
appear
on
the
comedy
central
show
broad
city
so
here
to
explain
more
be
millennial
political
strategist
sal
nice
to
see
you
welcome
to
the
show
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
too
so
be
this
millennial
strategy
on
the
part
of
Clinton
working
I
do
not
think
it
be
work
I
mean
she
be
try
real
hard
not
to
repeat
2008
where
she
lose
the
youth
vote
to
president
Obama
in
Iowa
which
cause
a
snowball
effect
of
he
win
the
nomination
so
she
be
not
take
any
chance
this
time
around
she
be
go
after
the
youth
vote
hard
but
it
be
not
landing
with
millennial
and
I
do
not
think
she
be
go
to
be
able
to
cross
that
threshold
to
get
a
majority
of
millennial
to
vote
for
she
at
least
in
the
primary
let
take
a
look
at
how
she
stack
up
against
Bernie
Sanders
and
millennial
58
%
for
Bernie
45
for
secretary
Clinton
here
be
the
issue
do
it
even
matter
do
the
millennial
vote
even
matter
when
you
stack
up
Democrats
Hillary
Clinton
blow
Bernie
Sanders
out
of
the
water
62
%
to
30
%
among
democrat
so
do
this
millennial
vote
really
matter
sal
I
think
it
do
I
think
it
matter
in
both
party
and
I
think
this
time
around
millennial
be
go
to
cause
upset
in
both
party
when
it
come
at
least
to
the
Iowa
Caucus
if
you
look
at
the
CBS
poll
she
lose
millennial
by
over
50
point
to
Bernie
Sanders
in
that
same
poll
80
%
--
over
80
%
of
millennial
be
enthusiastic
and
say
they
be
go
to
come
out
and
vote
in
the
Iowa
Caucus
now
we
know
that
millennial
say
they
be
go
to
vote
but
a
lot
of
time
they
do
not
show
up
so
if
you
go
back
to
2014
and
say
you
know
35
%
of
millennial
show
up
you
have
a
lot
to
worry
about
because
there
be
register
young
Democrats
in
the
state
of
Iowa
so
if
you
have
about
35
%
of
those
show
up
you
be
look
at
about
vote
which
be
a
lot
in
the
state
of
Iowa
and
can
bring
sanders
into
a
photo
finish
why
be
this
strategy
maybe
not
help
Hillary
Clinton
I
have
see
some
critic
say
look
it
be
because
it
seem
force
she
be
not
comfortable
do
these
sort
of
thing
and
she
probably
have
staff
member
tell
she
she
need
to
go
on
these
type
of
show
be
that
what
it
be
lack
of
authenticity
I
think
that
be
a
lack
of
authenticity
everything
spill
forth
and
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
lack
of
likability
I
think
democrat
do
like
Hillary
I
think
it
come
to
a
relatability
issue
I
think
also
it
be
she
policy
Bernie
Sanders
be
pretty
opposite
or
pretty
more
far
leave
than
Hillary
Clinton
be
on
a
lot
of
issue
she
be
not
go
to
change
she
policy
and
I
think
that
be
where
the
disconnect
be
with
millennial
they
prefer
Bernie
Sanders
more
socialistic
policy
than
hers
what
be
those
millennial
say
those
who
support
Bernie
Sanders
when
you
talk
to
they
what
be
they
say
about
Hillary
Clinton
because
she
end
up
win
and
get
the
nomination
be
they
go
to
go
over
to
she
camp
or
just
stay
home
and
not
vote
exactly
I
think
what
you
be
go
to
see
you
be
go
to
see
a
low
youth
vote
turnout
or
you
be
go
to
see
candidate
you
know
whoever
end
up
be
on
the
republican
side
a
outsider
candidate
bring
a
lot
of
those
independent
millennial
over
to
the
Republican
Party
which
be
the
key
to
win
the
White
House
and
I
think
that
a
lot
of
millennial
be
look
for
that
outsider
candidate
because
that
be
what
they
see
in
Barack
Obama
in
2008
be
the
outside
and
he
do
not
really
deliver
on
a
lot
of
he
promise
so
I
think
they
will
go
again
with
another
outsider
in
2016
hmm
2016
about
a
month
now
the
Iowa
caucus

there
be
so
many
lesson
that
it
be
hard
to
narrow
it
down
but
I
pick
five
start
with
it
be
the
year
to
be
offend
I
guess
to
be
fair
that
be
mostly
college
campus
but
these
be
we
future
leader
presumably
and
they
be
willing
to
toss
the
First
Amendment
and
say
you
must
not
offend
I
and
I
get
to
decide
if
I
be
offended
yeah
well
and
pew
research
they
just
find
that
40
%
of
college
student
be
okay
with
limit
speech
offensive
to
minority
do
this
surprise
you
well
it
should
but
since
I
have
go
to
campus
and
I
have
see
how
they
--
if
you
say
should
we
have
a
first
amendment
they
will
say
yes
but
should
there
be
no
hate
speech
should
we
punish
people
who
criticize
minority
it
be
instinctive
to
say
yes
a
lot
of
this
come
to
light
around
Halloween
and
other
time
throughout
2015
as
well
also
gun
law
do
not
--
a
lesson
we
have
learn
when
people
be
scared
very
often
politician
expand
government
do
not
they
they
do
and
the
liberal
want
to
press
gun
law
but
look
at
France
where
they
have
tough
gun
law
in
that
theater
these
creeps
shoot
and
then
stop
to
reload
have
one
--
in
America
in
Texas
a
few
people
in
the
audience
would
have
have
a
gun
and
there
would
have
be
much
less
death
and
may
have
be
a
very
different
outcome
also
you
say
you
can
not
kill
anything
in
Washington
what
do
this
mean
well
this
be
to
I
the
biggest
problem
be
that
America
go
broke
and
they
will
not
kill
anything
the
eximbank
they
almost
kill
this
be
corporate
welfare
we
still
have
farm
subsidy
and
the
estate
tax
once
something
be
temporary
in
Washington
if
it
be
about
money
come
from
we
to
they
it
never
go
away
and
next
up
if
you
be
loud
enough
and
sound
like
you
have
get
the
answer
people
will
vote
for
you
I
can
guess
that
you
be
talk
about
Donald
Trump
here
it
be
and
some
people
will
vote
for
he
he
be
not
the
front-runner
despite
what
people
say
because
the
poll
do
not
matter
it
be
the
bet
and
he
be
actually
third
but
look
he
sound
good
and
I
like
he
when
I
hear
he
on
tv
he
be
charming
in
a
way
so
what
be
he
tap
into
people
support
that
well
people
be
tick
off
at
the
pompous
we
be
in
charge
he
sound
smart
and
like
he
be
go
to
make
it
simpler
and
better
but
there
be
no
simple
answer
usually
definitely
sound
like
--
he
do
not
even
have
they
all
right
next
up
finally
if
you
lie
enough
people
will
stop
care
a
lot
of
people
say
that
this
e-mail
scandal
story
with
Hillary
Clinton
be
a
Fox
story
and
it
be
not
--
come
on
right
it
be
not
just
the
e-mail
story
it
be
the
list
of
story
Benghazi
--
on
my
show
we
do
a
long
list
that
go
back
before
Benghazi
the
one
that

not
misremember
stuff
like

just
lie
and
for
some
reason
she
and
bill
the
clinton
get
away
with

overwhelming
front-runner
all

all
feel
betray
by

and
do
not

world
to
show
mercy
to

use
he
new
year
mass
to
call
for
a
end
to
indifference
sometimes
we
ask
ourselves
how
it
be
possible
that
human
injustice
persist
unabated
and
that
the
organ
of
the
powerful
continue
to
demean
the
weak
relegate
they
to
the
most
squalid
outskirts
of
we
world
we
ask
how
long
human
evil
will
continue
to
sew
violence
and
hatred
in
we
word
how
could
the
fullness
of
time
come
when
we
be
witness
horde
of
man
woman
and
child
flee
war
hunger
and
persecution
ready
to
risk
they

simply
to
encounter
respect
for
they
fundamental

to
try
and
improve
they
situation
Lawrence
leap
report
new

be
suppose
to
be
a
time
of
hope
but
try
tell
that
to
the
poor
soul
stick
here
the
camp
have
grow
and
grow
and
yet
the
state
provide
barely
a
single
thing
to
cater
to
these
people
thing
here
that
make
life
at
all
bearable
have
be
do
by
volunteer
in
so
many
way
they
be
do
the
job
of
the
state
as
best
they
can
when
I
get
call
in
the
middle
of
the
night

on
what
to

really
angry
that
I
be
put
in
a
situation
where
I
feel
like
somebody
life
dependend
on
my
decision
and
I
feel
untrained
and
unsupported
and
unqualified
it
be
frustrating
do
anybody
care
about
this
not
much
in
northern
France
where
the
nearby
village
be
prosperous
people
have
offer
almost
nothing
to
they
impoverished
neighbor
the
national
front
take
40
%
of
the

in
recent
election
yet
up
the
road
in
Calais
you
get
a
sense
of
what
dunkirk
might
look
like
at
this
time
next
year
here
volunteer
be
everywhere
carpenter

there
be
hot
shower
and

at

not
to
put

fine
a
point
on
it
there

India
which
look
very
much
like
this
where
people
have
live
do
live
and
continue
to
live
for
year
and
year
the
point
about
this
place
be
that
the
complete
inability
of
the
british
and
french
government
to
offer
any
sort
of
solution
here
be
lend
this
camp
a
air
of
permanence
of

pitaneelaboot

there
be
be
a
lot
of
talk
about

in

I

PITANEELABOOT

who
do
the
dirty

these
man
be
round
up
last

the

say
the

it
be
the
epicenter
of

operation
in
the
country
hundred
of
refugee
be
at
the
site
some
be
too
weak
to
run
away
all
of
the
refugee
who
be
pick
up
be
take
to
a
regional
detention
center
in
Thai
detention
facility
they
be
deny
adequate
humanitarian
aid
the
abuse
they
be
endure
every
step
of
the
way
be
in
many
way
similar
at
this
facility
near
the
border
the
guard
would
not
permit
we
to
film
the
detainees
quarter
we
ask
the
staff
if
they
know
a
man
name
Ahmed
Khan
to
we
astonishment
they
bring
he
down
be
this
you
wife
it
be
ok
it
be
ok
Khan
be
the
husband
of
the

whose
relative
pay

she
release
he
be
round
up
by

in

march
raid
on
a

she
be
verry
worried
about
you
but
want
you
to
know
that
she
be
ok
the
guard
do
not
understand
the
Rohingya
language
so
we
be
able
to
ask
Khan
about
the
condition
upstairs
he
say
that
official
from
the
UN
High
Commission
on
refugee
UNHCR
come
to
the
facility
but
ignore
he
last
year
about
1300
Rohingya
detainees
be
deport
back
to
burma
more
than
200
be
still
languish
behind
bar
in
Thailand
the
UN
be
mandate
to
protect
refugee
population
and
right
now
the
UN
be
not
live
up
to
its
mandate
in
Thailand
this
be
a
objective
fact
we
have
be
try
right
from
the
begin
to
find
a
alternative
to
these
detention
center
Vivian
Tan
be
the
UNCHR
regional

in
Bangkok
she
argue
that
Thai
official
be
drag
they
foot
the
complaint
we
often
hear
be
that
unhcr
have
come
by
take
note
and
leave
-
with
no
follow
through
I
think
several
attempt
be
make
by
the
authority
to
identify
site
and
try
to
start
build
something
as
a
alternative
but
because
of
local
opposition
it
have
not
be
able
to
take
place
we
provide
unhcr
with
picture
of
Ahmed
Khan
and
Nur
anquis
and
pass
along
they
contact
information
in
the
hope
they
might
be
able
to
re-unite
the
couple
I
do
not
think
the
system
be
in
place
to
allow
for
that
I
will
need
to
check
with
my
colleague
in
the
Thailand
Office
I
have
be
ask

as
of
right
now
we

we

Richard

we

we

not

we
be
a
temporary

but
so
far
it
be
a
policy
area
that
government
for
its
own
reason
have
choose
not

so
many
Rohingya
pour

we
need
to

remain
scant
and
barracks
be
now
under

to
house
guard
to
keep
the
Rohingya
pen
in
there
be
be
no
serious
talk
whatsoever
about
rohingya
return
home
more
than
two
year
after
they
be
burn
out
of
they
home
and
village
which
be
a
problem
and
now
on
top
of
that
Rakhine
political
operative
be
propose
to
increase
the
size
of
detention
camp
very
strategically
they
do
it
first
create
the
situation
and
also
block
the
international
community
thirdly
give
facility
to
human
trafficker
with
police
and
immigration
take
the
money
then
you
can
go
easily
so
exit
be
open
if
this
kind
of
situation
continue
for
one
or
two
more
year
time
there
will
be
no
more
rohingya
living
in
Myanmar
the
number
of
people
get
on
boat
risk
they
life
to
leave
this
situation
be
only
increase
that
rest
on
the
shoulder
of
the
international
community
that
be
ultimately
fail
to
respond
in
a
way
that
will
promote
the
human
rights
of
this

the
bad

begin
to
break

get
ready
for
the

of

Mohammad
Idriss
will
be
among
those
head
out
but
Idriss
-
and
so
many
other
rohingya
Muslims
live
as
outcast
in
they
own
land
-
believe
that
risk
it
all
on
a
dangerous
journey
be
better
than
submit
to
a
slow
death
right
now
in
Tel

thing
they
be
wonder
about
be
be
this
just
a
escalation
of
the
violence
we
have
be
see
or
be
this
somehow
criminal
related
israeli
police
be
very
careful
to
say
they
just
do
not

good

a
good
sign
Americans
be
do
everything

home
grow
terror
plot
to
attack
people
celebrate
the
new
year
forward
by
the
feds
charge
with
attempt
to
provide
--
I
be
nervous
own
some
establishment
downtown
it
be
a
little
scary
but
then
I
sit
back
and
think
you
know
we
have
very
good
security
staff
and
there
be
great
police
presence
on
the
avenue
and
they
be
really
just
try
to
put
the
fear
into
we
talk
to
a
FBI
informant
he
discuss
use
a
bomb
and
kidnapping
people
I
will
take
a
life
I
do
not
have
a
problem
with
that
the
fed
say
on
Tuesday
he
go
to
a
area
Walmart
with
the
informant
to
stock
up
for
the
attack
buy
black
ski
mask
zip
tie
knife
a
machete
duct
tape
ammonia
and
latex
glove
there
be
also
a
new
normal
when
it
come
to
terrorism
governor
Cuomo
talk
about
the
suspect
alleged
path
to
radicalization
he
serve
time
inticaattica
become
a
muslim
and
on
the
internet
become
a
proponent
of
one
of
the
group
and
pledge
allegiance
to
the
ISIL
group
and
have
a
specific
plan
to
assassinate
people
but
luchman
neighbor
say
that
be
not
the
man
they
know
he
be
just
a
street
kid
he
be
not
a
hard
core
terrorist
just
be
stupid
he
could
face
up
to
20
year
in
prison
and
a
quarter
million
dollar
fine
he
have
some
criminal
instance
in
he
past
and
serve
time
for
a
robbery
due
back
in
court
next
week
let
check
in
with
Fred
Pelycoen
now
the
terror
fear
in
Germany
what
be
you
learn
absolutely
that
this
be
a
plot
that
at
least
be
inspire
by
Isis
and
it
be
interesting
because
apparently
the
original
tip-off
that
be
give
to
the
Munich
police
department
and
authority
come
from
intelligence
service
and
later
the
germ
get
the
same
information
from
the
french
as
well
and
that
be
when
they
decide
to
act
they
get
this
information
very
late
in
the
game
on
new
year
eve
and
decide
they
have
to
act
very
quickly
shut
off
the
Munich
main
railway
station
one
of
the
main
in
Germany
and
also
one
in
the
west
of
Munich
as
well
they
say
the
information
they
get
be
quite
specific
they
be
still
try
to
corroborate
whether
or
not
these
be
real
people
or
whether
or
not
these
be
phony
name
the
talk
be
of
about
five
to
seven
people
who
want
to
conduct
suicide
attack
at
midnight
on
new
year
eve
apparently
of
iraqi
and
syrian
origin
the
celebration
go
forward
lot
of
police
there
they
have
give
now
the
all
clear
they
be
still
very
much
in
heightened
state
of
alert
thank
you
so
much
let
discuss
boat
of
these
terrorist
fear
with
CNN
national
security
analyst
if
these
plot
be
in
indeed
real
what
do
this
tell
you
about
Isis
it
be
reach
determination
to
trorz
the
West
trorz
the
we
terrorize
terrorize
this
be
a
example
of
how
isis
be
take
different
approach
depend
on
where
they
be
as
we
all
have
see
in
the
last
year
Europe
be
a
much
easier
target
just
give
the
number
of
people
that
have
go
to
Syria
to
fight
they
then
come
back
they
be
able
to
form
they
be
able
to
plan
larger
scale
attack
what
we
see
in
Rochester
be
very
different
and
a
lot
of
people
may
read
that
indictment
and
say
this
do
not
seem
like
much
what
a
lot
--
what
the
FBI
be
do
now
be
essentially
make
very
public
arrest
even
against
people
who
seem
not
like
a
huge
threat
or
may
have
mental
disability
I
think
to
make
a
statement
to
other
that
the
FBI
be
watch
almost
like
act
as
a
deterrent
absolutely
and
I
think
in
this
case
in
particular
so
Isis
and
with
the
Lone
Wolf
wit
-
threat
be
make
people
who
might
plan
a
attack
slightly
paranoid
and
concerned
that
they
may
be
be
watch
and
in
this
case
it
be
a
perfect
example
of
someone
who
be
approach
by
a
FBI
informant
plan
with
the
FBI
informant
and
then
of
course
be
expose
by
the
FBI
informant
and
you
want
to
keep
they
a
little
bit
paranoid
and
on
they
toe
so
to
speak
so
that
they
then
do
not
plan
these
kind
of
attack
and
we
know
the
and
Europe
have
be
on
alert
because
of
the
recent
attack
and
the
holiday
but
what
do
you
make
of
any
potential
suspect
who
would
take
advantage
of
a
occasion
where
there
would
be
so
many
people
at
the
same
time
where
there
would
be
such
heighten
security
measure
the
United
States
concern
I
more
be
less
like
times
square
but
more
place
like
San
Bernardino
the
infinite
soft
target
we
have
on
random
day
those
attack
be
nerve
wracking
and
scary
because
one
they
be
hard
to
disrupt
but
two
the
good
news
at
least
be
--
they
tend
not
to
be
as
consequential
as
what
we
see
in
Paris
Paris
have
a
very
different
problem
which
be
the
capacity
of
Isis
member
or
those
who
have
be
train
by
Isis
to
actually
plan
and
execute
in
such
a
organized
fashion
that
be
much
more
difficult
in
the
United
States
for
a
variety
of
factor
and
Julia
perhaps
you
take
a
look
at
the
Washington
post
this
morning
and
see
this
headline
say
Obama
think
he
Syria
strategy
be
right
and
folk
just
do
not
get
it
and
it
talk
about
how
the
president
scold
he
aids
for
not
adequately
sell
he
antiisis
strategy
be
that
the
bigger
problem
perhaps
that
the
selling
of
the
strategy
undermine
its
effectiveness
and
then
send
a
less
than
reassure
signal
to
the
public
I
have
be
supportive
of
the
president
tactical
and
strategic
strategy
in
the
sense
it
be
a
long-term
strategy
it
be
not
a
quick
fix
like
close
the
border
but
I
think
it
be
a
long
term
strategy
where
I
do
think
the
community
and
resonate
with
the
american
people
about
they
own
concern
and
then
you
have
more
extreme
people
talk
about
not
let
Muslims
or
some
of
the
more
extreme
measure
we
have
be
hear
I
think
we
need
to
take
a
deep
breathe
in
the
new
year
recognize
there
be
a
threat
but
also
recognize
that
we
can
not
lose
we
head
in
the
process
of
combat
a
threat
that
while
scary
be
also
something
that
be
manageable
if
we
just
effectuate
the
plan
and
Super
Quick
flipside
to
that
how
much
of
you
strategy
would
you
ever
want
to
really
reveal
that
be
exactly
right
especially
in
the
United
States
what
we
see
with
what
be
happen
in
Rochester
be
there
be
a
lot
go
on
that
we
actually
do
not
know
about
until
it
be
expose
in
a
court
or
in
a
indictment
and
this
be
go
on
throughout
the
United
States
and
I
think
what
we
need
to
do
now
be
recognize
you
see
the
polling
people
be
nervous
and
I
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
nervousness
be
real
it
be
not
irrational
and
then
address
it
in
way
that
we
can
over
the
next
year
but
there
be
no
quick
fix
even
what
we
be
hear
by
a
number
of
people
that
none
of
those
be
quick
fix
to
a
long-term
problem
that
we
have
Julia
thank
you
so
much
and
happy
new
year
you
too
Russia
think
NATO
expansion
be
a
threat
and
Vladimir
Putin
have
approve
a
new
security
strategy
in
response
the
detail
from
Moscow
next
everybody
have
a
dream
mine
be
to
see
the
ocean
and
with
a
little
help
I
make
it
welcome
back
we
continue
to
monitor
a
situation
out
of
Tel
Aviv
where
investigator
continue
to
intensify
the
certainly
more
a
gunman
someone
who
open
fire
outside
of
a
bar
restaurant
there
on
a
popular
street
in
Tel
Aviv
he
be
wear
black
and
carry
a
m-16
two
be
dead
and
four
injure
and
a
new
strategy
in
Russia
which
be
now
declare
NATO
a
threat
Vladimir
Putin
endorse
the
plan
say
the
build
up
threaten
he
country
national
security
Matthew
Chan
with
more
on
Moscow
about
this
there
be
a
couple
of
point
to
come
out
of
this
document
which
be
a
sort
of
official
document
that
Russia
have
to
up
every
six
year
it
be
last
update
in
2009
so
time
be
ripe
for
this
new
description
essentially
of
the
threat
to
the
russian
state
as
the
Kremlin
see
it
and
it
say
that
it
see
the
expansion
of
NATO
the
Wester
military
alliance
as
the
major
threat
to
Russia
national
interest
and
it
also
say
that
be
because
Russia
what
it
call
independent
domestic
and
foreign
policy
which
have
trigger
a
counteraction
from
United
States
and
its
ally
so
I
think
the
reference
there
be
to
the
fact
that
Russia
have
engage
in
military
activity
in
Ukraine
engage
in
Syria
as
well
carry
air
strike
against
Isis
and
other
rebel
group
in
support
of
Al
Assad
and
he
ally
and
that
be
angered
the
United
States
and
NATO
country
in
general
so
this
be
a
formal
document
that
say
NATO
be
a
threat
but
it
do
not
necessarily
represent
a
big
shift
in
the
thinking
of
Russia
Russia
and
Putin
in
particular
have
be
describe
NATO
as
a
strategic
threat
to
Russia
for
some
year
now
and
indeed
that
threat
have
come
to
a
head
over
the
conflict
in
Ukraine
try
to
prevent
Ukraine
from
join
NATO
and
other
western
institution
want
to
prevent
the
further
expansion
of
NATO
and
have
make
that
now
a
priority
in
term
of
its
national
security

levee
top
cut
of
roadway
this
morning
the
biggest
concern
how
to
get
around
the
National
Guard
join
the
fight
overnight
to
keep
lane
of
this
major
interstate
open
I-55
one
of
the
only
way
to
cross
the
Meramec
river
right
now
closure
still
in
effect
on
that
bridge
the
town
of
Valley
Park
and
Jennifer
Gray
be
there
how
do
it
look
this
morning
lot
of
high
water
yeah
lot
of
high
water
look
like
we
be
stand
at
the
end
of
a
boat
launch
but
this
be
actually
highway
141
and
you
can
see
at
the
end
there
interstate
44
and
believe
it
or
not
the
water
have
go
down
considerably
actually
it
be
go
down
almost
six
foot
if
you
can
believe
it
but
we
still
have
a
long
long
way
to
go
it
be
go
to
be
at
least
until
tomorrow
or
Sunday
before
thing
start
to
look
a
little
closer
to
normal
where
we
be
right
around
Louis
though
the
Mississippi
River
there
be
crest
now
will
most
likely
do
that
throughout
the
entire
day
so
the
water
be
still
very
very
high
a
lot
of
place
still
vulnerable
you
be
talk
about
the
levee
concern
they
evacuate
people
in
that
area
a
couple
of
day
ago
and
the
latest
update
say
the
levee
be
hold
fine
but
it
be
still
go
to
be
a
fluid
situation
until
those
water
can
start
to
recede
so
the
weekend
be
go
to
be
a
very
crucial
time
to
watch
all
of
that
as
the
water
continue
to
go
down
but
Fred
it
be
go
to
be
a
long
road
ahead
for
people
here
not
only
do
they
have
sewage
float
in
this
water
as
we
have
be
talk
about
yesterday
in
the
report
as
well
as
this
morning
but
also
the
mud
and
silt
from
the
Mississippi
River
t
MERAMEC
river
leave
behind
not
to
mention
all
the
trash
and
debris
a
lot
of

not
to
mention
toxin
too
because
of
car
flood
out
lot
of
dirty
stuff
in
that
water
thanks
so
much
Jennifer
Gray
in
this
break
news
we
continue
to
watch
Israeli
second
largest
city
Tel
Aviv
reel
after
a
gunman
open

a
crowd

a
pub
and
at
least
two
confirm
dead
several
other
wound
a
police
search
for
the

go
through

those
two
eye
witness
that
tell
israeli
radio
describe
the
person
as
wear
all
black
and
carry
a
m-16
and
that
be
why
the
police
right
now
be
very
careful
but
also
go
and
search
every
nook
and
cranny
because
this
person
be
still
believe
to
be
arm
and
two
people
be
kill
four
seriously
injured
but
still
the
police
be
very
careful
about
place
blame
on
this

now
they
be
say
that
it
could
be
criminal

could
be
a
palestinian

fredericka
thank
you
so
much
president
Obama
spend
he
first
day
of
the
new
year
in
Hawaii
the
president
and
family
wrap
up
they
vacation
there
and
return
to
Washington
will
be
pretty
busy
for
the
president
as
he
enter
he
final
year
in
office
in
in
just
a
matter
of
day
he
deliver
he
last
state
of
the
union
address
and
among
the
highlight
a
new
executive
action
on
gun
ask
plan
to
close
Guantanamo
Bay
Jim
Acosta
have
more
from
Hawaii
during
he
vacation
here
in
Hawaii
President
Obama
have
be
work
with
he
top
aids
on
the
upcoming
state
of
the
union
speech
to
set
the
tone
for
he
last
year
in
office
and
right
at
the
top
of
the
agenda
be
gun
control
for
president
Obama
the
final
round
be
about
to
begin
in
2016
I
be
go
leave
it
out
all
on
the
field
up
first
in
the
president
eighth
and
last
year
Obama
long
response
to
mass
shooting
in
the
aim
at
the
gun
show
loophole
which
allow
some
firearm
seller
to
avoid
conduct
background
check
on
they
customer
the
White
House
argue
the
president
action
will
be
within
he
connect
executive
authority
and
in
line
with
poll
that
show
tighten
support
for
background
check
unfortunately
Congress
have
show
the
courage
so
that
be
why
the
president
ask
he
team
to
o
to
be
look
into
it
the
president
of
the
NRA
be
say
the
president
be
do
what
he
always
do
when
he
do
not
get
it
way
defy
the
will
of
the
people
and
take
executive
action
it
will
be
a
uphill
battle
the
president
also
hope
to
travel
to
Cuba
and
perhaps
more
than
a
dozen
other
country
in
what
be
shape
up
to
be
a
global
farewell
tour
but
the
agenda
could
be
up
end
by
se
set
back
in
the
war
on
Isis
a
foreign
policy
crisis
that
could
complicate
plan
to
have
the
president
campaign
heavily
with
the
2016
nominee
a
prospect
that
may
well
put
he
and
Hillary
Clinton
on
the
trail
together
again
I
think
we
will
have
that
Strom
Democratic
nominee
I
think
that
democratic
nominee
will
win
first
the
president
lay
out
he
plan
at
the
fast
approach
state
of
the
union
address
less
that
be
two
week
from
now
do
not
expect
a
long
list
of
proposal
in
part
because
the
president
be
almost
out
of
time
so
the
president
already
get
a
head
start
on
he
2016
agenda
by
urge
Congress
to
pass
law
that
would
help
reduce
gun
violence
and
all
across
America
survivor
of
gun
violence
and
those
who
lose
a
child
or
a
parent
or
a
spouse
to
gun
violence
be
force
to
mark
such
awful
anniversary
every
single
day
and
yet
Congress
still
have
not
do
anything
to
prevent
what
happen
to
they
from
happen
to
other
family
so
the
president
new
executive
action
on
gun
due
out
next
week
be
expect
to
expand
background
check
on
gun
sale
and
include
government
funding
to
help
better
enforce
gun
law
already
on
the
book
with
I
now
to
talk
about
this
historian
Douglas
Brinkley
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
to
you
we
know
president
Obama
be
focus
on
unfinished
business
in
he
last
year
gun
control
top
the
list
now
he
vow
to
use
more
executive
privilege
what
do
you
expect
in
he
final
state
of
the
union
well
he
be
definitely
go
to
want
to
try
to
address
the
gun
issue
as
you
just
mention
this
be
something
that
be
a
pet
peeve
of
the
president
he
be
angeredpy
the
fact
that
much
of
he
presidency
have
to
deal
with
shooting
and
mass
killing
so
he
be
try
to
find
if
Congress
will
not
help
some
executive
tool
legal
tool
that
will
help
he
get
gun
control
be
a
major
part
of
he
legacy
in
he
last
year
also
climate
change
this
president
have
put
a
lot
of
skin
in
that
game
he
get
a
result
out
of
Paris
recently
and
now
he
have
to
come
home
and
sell
climate
change
to
the
american
public
and
I
expect
those
will
be
the
two
main
thrust
of
the
state
of
the
union
along
with
how
to
defeat
isil
okay
and
when
you
look
at
recent
polling
and
50
%
say
they
have
a
unfavorable
view
of
the
president
will
it
be
important
to
the
president
to
try
to
turn
those
number
around
in
2016
how
much
of
he
legacy
be
shape
by
that
kind
of
sentiment
well
as
the
good
question
Ronald
Reagan
use
to
say
you
do
not
want
to
have
a
box
office
that
go
below
50
%
if
he
could
hover
at
50
he
probably
would
be
satisfy
with
that
but
I
be
afraid
that
with
unless
thing
get
better
give
the
war
on
terror
any
time
there
be
a
strike
anywhere
any
time
we
have
a
situation
people
in
some
way
blame
the
president
for
some
kind
of
security
breech
or
he
be
not
work
closely
love
with
ally
so
it
be
go
to
be
hard
to
keep
he
50
go
but
do
not
think
Barack
Obama
he
presidency
be
over
that
he
be
a
complete
lame
duck
the
very
fact
be
Hillary
Clinton
be
go
to
need
he
in
the
democratic
party
Barack
Obama
have
a
90
%
or
more
approval
rating
with
african
Americans
he
need
to
generate
that
vote
and
there
be
Obama
Democrats
can
he
start
bring
out
the
vote
for
Hillary
Clinton
particularly
in
urban
setting
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
see
as
the
year
turn
into
the
fall
and
many
argue
about
whether
polling
be
you
know
be
that
important
but
when
it
do
come
to
the
satisfaction
with
the
and
how
it
be
be
govern
there
be
this
polling
that
say
only
24
%
say
they
be
satisfied
how
be
the
president
to
interpret
this
be
it
a
reflection
of
how
he
be
govern
or
how
the
White
House
and
Congress
be
or
be
not
work
together
if
you
be
president
Barack
Obama
and
if
you
do
see
poll
you
do
not
like
the
way
you
make
yourself
feel
better
be
then
go
look
at
what
the
congressional
poll
be
--
yeah
exactly
Congress
be
just
abysmal
polling
record
so
basically
he
will
say
it
be
Congress
fault
the
reason
we
have
not
do
something
dramatic
be
Congress
fault
why
be
not
Congress
back
the
war
on
isil
president
tend
to
blame
Congress
and
the
press
for
thing
they
be
unable
to
get
do
and
I
suspect
president
Obama
be
like
all
the
other
and
overall
what
do
you
think
will
comprise
of
the
president
legacy
what
will
be
he
lasting
mark
well
the
economy
when
he
come
in
we
have
the
great
recession
there
be
a
feeling
that
we
nation
financial
system
be
hemorrhage
here
we
be
several
year
later
and
just
look
at
the
Wall
Street
ticker
tape
or
look
at
index
for
home
price
and
unemployment
have
go
way
down
so
I
think
he
be
go
to
want
to
say
I
pull
we
out
of
the
great
recession
he
can
not
say
that
yet
in
true
term
because
he
still
have
another
year
to
go
and
as
we
know
anything
could
happen
the
economy
bomb
on
George
Bush
in
2008
he
last
year
so
first
of
all
he
have
to
keep
the
economy
alive
this
year
if
he
want
to
achieve
one
of
these
above
average
or
outstanding
leg
sis
happy
new
year
thank
you
be
much
happy
new
year
take
care
of
yourself
still
o
come
we
be
follow
the

what
happense

course
if
he

whatever
he

be
fair

how

to
quash
and
what
that
mean
be
they
say
we
be
not
go
to
honor
the
subpoena
why
should
she
have
to
testify
in
a
deposition
there
be
a
spousal
privilege
to
anything
she
might
have
say
to
she
husband
and
also
represent
undue
burden
because
of
the
fact
she
be
not
involve
but
the
judge
say
no
you
be
go
to
have
to
testify
and
in
that
deposition
remember
it
be
very
broad
the
question
attorney
can
ask
and
as
you
might
imagine
the
attorney
be
go
to
focus
on
somewhat
she
know
and
when
she
know
it
what
do
crow
know
about
you
husband
impropriety
who
have
you
husband
be
with
do
you
know
at
any
point
what
he
be
do
with
they
be
you
with
he
if
not
where
be
you
have
you
use
pill
when
how
what
do
you
know
about
that
I
would
suspect
certainly
the
attorney
be
go
to
focus
in
on
what
she
show
about
he
sexual
history
involve
multiple
other
woman
and
discovery
remember
be
very
broad
so
attorney
can
ask
broad
base
question
and
what
ultimately
she
tell
they
can
in
fact
prove
dam
to
he
in
the
meantime
Cosby
attorney
one
of
they
be
on
CNN
last
night
and
dispute
cosby
contact
with
Andrea
Constand
be
illegal
listen
the
complaint
in
this
case
take
it
willingly
after
complain
of
be
inable
to
sleep
and
complain
of
pain
to
the
head
so
the
action
you
describe
from
the
deposition
I
know
you
know
be
not
criminal
so
the
fact
that
someone
take
some
medication
--
you
say
that
I
know
that
that
be
--
consensual
sexual
contact
be
not
illegal
you
--
so
what
about
this
argument
despite
the
out
come
of
the
court
settlement
of
the
constand
in
the
previous
suit
COSBY
attorney
be
maintain
the
contact
be
con
sense
shl
from
start
to
finish
this
be
where
the
battle
ground
be
draw
obviously
consensual
contact
be
not
mutually
the
fact
you
have
pill
into
she
render
she
incapable
of
speak
I
give
she
the
pill
upon
she
request
that
I
give
they
to
she
to
help
she
with
she
sleep
anything
we
do
may
have
do
or
be
allege
we
do
because
there
be
a
romantic
relationship
and
so
the
whole
issue
of
consent
and
in
that
clip
where
you
see
she
with
Brianna
Keeler
the
attorney
for
cosby
make
the
argument
that
be
go
to
be
argument
may
make
to
the
jury
these
occur
by
Bill
Cosby
and
Andrea
Constand
but
at
all
time
Andrea
be
on
board
and
if
the
jury
do
not
buy
that
then
of
course
there
be
a
conviction
so
that
be
go
to
be
something
we
be
go
to
have
to
focus
on
and
see
credibility
do
the
jury
in
fact
concur
that
Andrea
Constand
you
know
do
not
want
anything
to
do
with
Cosby
of
that
variety
or
do
they
believe
cosby
crew
in
say
do
you
know
what
everything
that
happen
be
something
that
adult
agree
to
and
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
any
of
the
accuser
would
be
take
to
the
stand
none
of
they
pursue
any
criminal
charge
that
be
huge
I
be
willing
to
believe
the
judge
will
keep
out
a
lot
of
that
if
other
come
forward
and
say
in
a
criminal
case
bill
cosby
do
something
to
they
what
be
they
go
to
be
believe
the
attorney
be
a
go
to
really
limit
the
playing
field
and
attempt
to
get
the
judge
to
focus
on
what
happen
with
Andrea
Constand
and
not
with
what
happen
with
accuser
one
two
three
four
--
I
can
count
all
the
way
up
to
fifty
so
it
be
go
to
be
tough

have
a
very
big
lead
I
intend
to
keep

not
because
I
want
the
job
but
because
I
want
to
do
something
great
for
the
country
and
great
for
the
people
I
hope
we
be
go
to
carry
it
out
and
get
it
do
mirror
they
show
we
all
we
problem
area
those
place
that
we
can
not
wish
or
squish
away
well
now
fear
no
mirror
and
eliminate
those
problem
area
with
coolsculpt
-
the
patented
cooling
technology
target
and
kill
fat
cell
with
no
surgery
or
downtime
so
if
you
want
to
see
a
slimmer
you
when
you
look
in
the
mirror
go
to
today
and
choose
from
over
two
thousand
provider
nationwide
my
husband
drink
with
friend
after
work
he
have
a
couple
of
drink
at
home
with
dinner
and
a
few
more
while
we
watch
tv
a
counselor
recommend
I
try
al-anon
family
group
I
do
not
want
to
go
to
al-anon
but
I
be
sure
glad
i
do
be
someone
drinking
break
you
heart
you
might
be
surprise
at
what
you
can
learn
in
a
al-anon
family
group
from
people
just
like
you
call
1-888-4al-anon
or
go
to
al-anon
org
in
Tel
Aviv
we
be
get
word
a
gunman
open
fire
on
Friday
afternoon
police
say
the
more
tough
be
not
immediately
clear
it
be
not
know
if
the
attacker
be
palestinian
or
a
gangland
shooting
we
will
keep
you
jowch
date
as
we
hear
more
Republican
presidential
frontrunner
Donald
Trump
quite
literally
ring
in
the
new
year
with
Fox
News
prompt
he
family
to
join
host
Kimberly
Guilfoyle
and
Eric
bolling
I
have
a
very
big
lead
and
we
intend
to
keep
it
that
I
can
tell
you
we
have
a
very
very
big
lead
join
we
be
Alan
Colmes
Chris
first
to
you
he
do
not
have
a
big
lead
in
Iowa
be
it
time
for
thing
to
start
get
real
it
be
time
thing
get
real
he
be
get
a
17-point
lead
nationally
in
I
wait
place
where
a
ground
game
matter
this
be
not
they
first
primary
they
will
probably
show
up
there
and
I
think
the
spread
will
be
more
than
three
point
but
then
again
this
be
a
primary
like
we
have
never
see
before
Donald
Trump
be
a
candidate
we
can
not
use
history
to
predict
the
only
thing
you
can
soundsly
say
for
sure
be
2016
will
be
most
interesting
thing
politically
since
Barrie
Goldwater
beat
Rockefeller
Alan
Colmes
the
Boston
Globe
unorthodoxed
opponent
be
hard
to
beat
if
you
be
advise
Ted
Cruz
and
say
no
a
job
you
do
not
want
how
do
he
hold
on
in
Iowa
he
have
a
better
chance
in
Iowa
than
trump
do
Trump
be
not
resonate
in
Iowa
Cruz
be
do
well
with
evangelical
he
seem
to
be
the
person
on
the
rise
at
the
moment
historically
the
Republican
who
win
Iowa
do
not
necessarily
get
the
nomination
that
certainly
do
not
end
it
for
trump
but
he
be
wrong
about
a
year
from
now
tblght
White
House
unless
he
be
break
and
enter
he
do
not
take
office
until
the
21st
just
jump
the
fence
like
everybody
else
seem
to
be
do
these
day
this
be
what
he
have
to
say
about
the
general
I
think
I
will
be
she
worst
nightmare
but
we
will
find
out
she
will
not
do
the
job
we
be
go
to
do
the
job
and
we
be
go
to
do
some
special
thing
he
say
no
problem
I
will
beat
Hillary
as
well
one
national
poll
he
be
not
win
be
against
Hillary
Clinton
in
a
head-to-head
matchup
you
can
not
win
a
national
election
with
those
kind
of
disapproval
number
with
those
group
so
I
be
sure
democrat
would
love
to
see
Donald
trump
be
the
nominee
there
be
no
way
with
those
number
he
can
win
a
general
election
be
we
go
back
to
a
potential
gold
water
shellac
for
republican
I
think
it
be
possible
if
donald
trump
get
the
nomination
but
we
have
not
be
able
to
use
history
as
a
predictor
in
this
primary
Marco
Rubio
be
the
only
republican
candidate
beat
Hillary
and
be
likely
to
win
the
general
election
he
job
will
be
to
show
that
get
rid
of
Chris
Christie
get
rid
of
Jeb
Bush
he
have
come
in
third
place
in
Iowa
but
even
if
you
add
all
the
more
moderate
and
the
conservative
vote
together
behind
he
Donald
trump
be
still
ahead
unless
something
happen
and
someone
can
pop
this
bubble
which
might
start
to
happen
then
Republicans
be
in
for
a
real
tough
election
we
will
leave
it
at
that
as
we
start
the
new
year
one
month
from
today
we
will
talk
about
result
Abby
what
be
come
up
if
you
notice
a
slip

I
be
like
wow
if
I
could
save
this
much
then
I
could
maybe
upgrade
a
little
bit
we
realize
okay
this
not
only
could
be

we
could

also
take

the

watch

then
you
can
switch
over
the
stock
market
expect
to
bounce
back
after
post
its
worst
year
since
the
financial
crisis
happy
new
year
it
be
a
rough
year
for
stock
the
worse
since
2008
year
of
the
recession
can
we
expect
a
better
year
in
2016
stock
go
negative
if
you
look
at
where
we
be
a
year
ago
stock
be
down
a
negative
1
%
to
2
%
2016
will
be
a
holding
year
everybody
include
investor
will
be
focus
on
what
happen
with
this
huge
monumentally
important
presidential
elect
I
will
make
a
prediction
this
time
next
year
start
in
January
of
2017
we
could
see
a
big
bull
market
standing
especially
if
Republicans
win
a
year
from
now
president
Obama
reign
will
be
over
and
I
suspect
we
will
have
a
more
pro
growth
president
and
that
will
be
a
good
thing
Abby
a
good
strategy
for
deal
with
the
stock
market
you
listen
buy
low
sell
high
that
be
good
advice
a
lot
of
time
people
make
a
mistake
when
they
see
a
start
of
a
bear
market
people
kind
of
panic
and
sell
they
stock
when
the
market
be
fall
if
you
be
in
the
to
be
market
for
the
long
run
5
or
10
or
20
year
for
you
retirement
plan
do
not
sell
you
stock
I
be
a
big
believe
the
stock
market
be
the
best
place
to
hold
you
money
for
a
long-term
investment
what
be
you
thought
on
gas
price
what
with
you
prediction
be
they
go
to
day
low
and
be
that
a
good
thing
for
the
economy
I
love
it
he
type
i
go
to
the
pump
I
be
pay
$
a
gallon
it
be
the
equivalent
of
a
tax
cut
for
the
american
consumer
think
about
where
we
be
18
month
ago
the
average
consumer
family
be
save
$
500
to
$
a
year
if
I
on
have
to
pay
$
30
to
fill
up
my
take
instead
of
$
60
then
you
have
get
more
money
to
spend
I
think
it
be
a
good
news
story
and
I
can
not
predict
the
fluctuation
in
the
oil
market
but
we
will
not
go
back
to
$
4
a
gallon
gasoline

quite
a
scare
during

what
a
scary
night
for
people
there
be
the
fire
now
under
control
the
actual
fire
be
under
control
but
the
operation
be
not
over
yet
this
be
video
from
earlier
today
of
the
address
hotel
it
be
still
smolder
firefighter
have
to
let
the
fire
burn
because
they
do
not
have
the
equipment
to
get
up
there
so
high
the
HOALSS
and
ladder
to
get
up
there
the
fire
start
at
last
night
they
say
a
20th
floor
tear
last
of
the
60-floor
tower
but
witness
say
they
have
believe
it
start
on
the
ground
floor
and
the
cause
be
unknown
it
do
not
appear
this
be
link
to
terror
activity
but
witness
say
it
engulf
the
side
of
the
building
official
say
the
state
of
the
art
fire
system
prevent
it
from
spread
further
incredibly
only
16
people
be
injure
14
with
minor
injury
one
moderately
injure
and
one
person
suffer
a
heart
attack
during
the
evacuation
process
those
we
speak
with
say
it
be
a
orderly
process
and
dread
ite
emergency
official
but
we
be
hear
the
story
of
people
escape
one
guy
reportedly
say
he
strap
he
disabled
mother
to
he
back
as
be
try
to
escape
the
building
as
well
the
firework
celebration
go
on
as
plan
after
that
they
do
the
show
do
go
on
it
be
certainly
quite
the
contrast
on
one
side
of
what
be
call
the
Khalifa
Lake
you
have
the
tower
inferno
if
you
will
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
you
have
the
tallest
sky
scraper
in
the
world
and
it
be
incredible
the
massive
firework
celebration
one
of
the
world
largest
so
not
only
be
it
already
a
huge
logistical
and
security
operation
but
then
you
have
this
quite
a
dramatic
scene
thank
you
train
be
up
and
run
in
Munich
Germany
but
police
be
warn
a
suicide
attack
be
still
the
a
threat
the
not
involve
two
bomber
plan
to
blow
themselves
you
have
at
midnight
when
the
clock
strike
nothing
happen
and
the
train
station
be
shut
down
join
we
now
Dave
Sears
a
former
navy
seal
and
member
of
seal
team
6
suicide
bomber
on
the
run
in
a
area
as
densely
populate
as
Europe
this
be
when
you
will
need
intelligence
at
local
level
that
be
how
you
will
catch
these
guy
it
be
hard
to
stop
you
be
absolutely
right
when
you
have
think
about
local
intelligence
if
they
have
suicide
vest
with
they
they
can
still
blow
themselves
up
we
be
hear
it
be
possible
one
of
the
attacker
be
go
to
blow
himself
you
have
in
the
train
station
and
another
attacker
be
go
to
wait
until
the
emergency
personnel
descend
this
have
become
a
popular
tactic
and
it
make
sense
but
that
say
it
be
give
up
the
tactic
to
we
we
emergency
response
know
how
to
deal
with
that
and
they
will
look
for
that
as
we
look
at
the
picture
come
out
of
Germany
from
last
night
when
they
shut
the
train
station
down
heavily
armed
police
in
those
kind
of
thing
but
with
as
many
soft
starringr
target
that
exist
in
big
city
it
seem
it
do
matter
whether
terrorist
walk
into
the
strain
station
where
you
have
a
lot
of
police
presence
or
walk
into
a
cafe
where
you
have
no
police
presence
they
blow
themselves
up
and
the
result
largely
the
same
it
can
be
with
a
suicide
bomber
vest
you
can
get
to
they
and
mitigate
how
much
damage
be
do
have
the
presence
of
armed
police
and
people
in
those
situation
do
help
the
situation
without
a
doubt
you
think
about
this
big
picture
you
talk
about
last
night
in
New
York
City
there
be
police
officer
in
Times
Square
you
could
not
walk
more
than
a
couple
foot
before
a
police
officer
look
at
you
and
say
happy
new
year
across
New
York
there
be
a
large
police
presence
be
there
too
much
focus
be
put
on
these
major
event
and
not
enough
on
intelligence
effort
and
those
kind
of
thing
to
stop
these
attack
and
plot
before
they
be
able
to
take
place
I
do
not
think
it
be
a
you
have
get
to
have
the
people
on
the
ground
let
look
at
Tel
Aviv
the
security
apparatus
in
Israel
deal
with
this
all
the
time
they
be
not
able
to
stop
everything
that
say
they
be
do
a
great
job
and
you
be
go
to
get
if
the
majority
of
these
guy
the
Israelis
learn
to
Mitt
Gate
and
respond
quickly
enough
be
that
where
we
be
head
in
the
United
States
we
will
end
up
have
arm
security
guard
pat
mall
and
every
cafe
check
people
before
they
go
into
the
olive
garden
and
Times
Square
unfortunately
we
may
start
down
that
road
more
I
think
in
the
big
soft
target
place
you
will
see
more
of
that
there
be
so
many
soft
target
in
the
United
States
so
many
event
as
well
as
we
point
out
we
thanks
to

too
much
pressure
on
yourself
if

of
the

because
they
be
misuse
overuse
or
useless
like
break
the
internet
man
spreading
we
know
some
people
that
make
that
famous
and
one
of
the
biggest
offender
of
the

so
a
lot
of
we
use
that
to
start
a
sentence
which
would
be
such
a
no-no
the
creator
of
Star

throw
a
wet
blanket
on
all
the
love
for
the
latest
movie
he
be
apologize
but
Disney
could
not
be
happy
about
this
so
--
so
here
we
go
George
Lucas
the
storied
founder
say
when
he
sell
the
rights
to
star
war
to
Disney
it
be
like
sell
he
child
to
white
slaver
awkward
some
people
call
this
attack
of
the
moan
Lucas
say
Disney
be
not
keen
to
have
he
around
this
be
tape
before
the
movie
premiere
to
huge
success
fastest
film
to
hit
a

Giant

business
success
here
so
you
can
only
imagine
how
Disney
react
behind
choose
CLO
door
Lucas
later
say
it
be
inappropriate
and
he
respect
Disney
and
he
say
in
a
way
Lynn
listen
for
the
humanity
he
say
leave
Star
Wars
be
like
a
breakup
or
divorce
messy
and
very
very
hard
to
do
so
in
a
way
I
can
see
why
he
would
have
conflict
feeling
that
might
make
a
mistake
the
phone
carrier

stop
offer

a

this
Kabuki
Star
have
take
on
this
unique
form
of
Kabuki
the

concern
a

eight
a

fruit
that
turn
he
body

the

the
show
producer
have
to
figure
out
how
to
bring
the
fantasy
to
the
stage
they
come
up
with
playful
idea
to
make
he
arm
look
like
it
be
get
longer
support
performer
link
arm
and
make
a
long
fake
arm
appear

new
way
to

he
say

fighting
style

determine
to
bring
one
more
key
element
of
the
story
to
the
stage
Kabuki
actor
do
not
connect
with
the
audience
I
want
more
excitement
it
be
the
importance
of
friendship
between
buddy
he
want
to
create
a
strong
bond
between
the
actor
and
the
audience
to
break
down
barrier
he
invite
everyone
to
sing
the
theme
song
together
that
be
another
nontraditional
feature
of
this
kabuki
the
audience
clap
along
the
lively
spectacle
of
Kabuki

be
amazing
like

of
England
what
be
happen
hello
we
be
keep
a
eye
on
what
take
place
last
week
that
continue
to
have
a
impact
over
the
bright
I
wish
aisle
we
have
a
storm
name
frank
that
roll
over
England
and
continue
to
move
away
it
be
no
longer
a
part
of
the
story
as
a
active
system
however
we
be
still
watch
the
impact
from
all
the
rain
that
have
fall
over
the
area
you
can
see
the
flooding
from
a
picture
come
out
on
Thursday
in
York
England
and
this
be
actually
debris
on
top
of
float
water
so
flooding
continue
to
be
a
issue
over
this
area
and
it
be
not
a
good
thing
when
another
system
move
its
way
toward
the
british
aisle
because
another
low
be
develop
wind
and
rain
continue
to
move
across
the
northeast
area
that
be
still
cope
with
the
flooding
that
be
take
place
be
go
to
see
even
more
rainfall
as
we
go
throughout
the
day
Friday
and
even
into
the
weekend
so
it
be
go
to
still
be
a
problem
for
the
next
couple
of
day
I
do
want
to
point
out
what
be
happen
down
toward
Turkey
a
low
pressure
system
be
drive
in
cold
wind
from
the
north
and
move
over
the
black
sea
that
be
create
sea
effect
snow
a
lot
more
snow
not
forecast
as
we
move
forward
in
time
on
top
of
that
some
chilly
air
we
be
talk
about
high
down
to
negative
13
in
Moscow
come
up
on
Friday
that
be
cold
below
average
for
this
time
of
year
that
cold
air
extend
into
Warsaw
and
Kiev
dryer
towards
central
portion
of
Europe
now
we
be
also
talk
about
the
flooding
issue
in
North
America
again
from
a
system
that
impact
the
northern
portion
of
the
United
States
earlier
last
week
and
now
we
be
talk
the
rain
and
all
that
water
flow
down
through
the
Mississippi
and
down
through
Missouri
Missouri
on
Thursday
look
at
flooding
problem
because
the
river
be
continue
to
rise
and
that
mean
submerged
house
as
well
and
I
think
we
will
see
more
problem
as
the
river
continue
to
move
up
now
the
good
news
on
at
least
the
little
silver
lining
be
that
we
be
not
look
at
more
rain
toward
the
north
because
of
that
as
long
as
it
stay
dry
we
just
need

the

up

we
do
see
a
wintry
weather
pattern
that
will
continue
as
we
go
through
the
first
weekend
of
2016
in
Japan
a
little

on

Francis
Fraser

I
be
join
by
a
renaissance
specialist
in
charge
of
the
collection
and
heritage
thank
you
very
much
for
be
with
we
can
you
tell
we
how
this
hunting
lodge
be
turn
into
a
veritable
palace
by
King
Francis
in
1526
when
Francis
begin
to
show
a
interest
in
Fontainebleau
it
be
a
old
castle
in
ruin
with
collapsed
roof
top
at
first
Francis
decide
to
renovate
the
castle
so
as
to
be
able
to
live
in
it
quite
quickly
because
he
be
a
huge
fan
of
hunting
and
this
castle
be
set
in
forest
teem
with
game
from
then
on
and
until
he
death
Francis
continue
to
build
and
expand
on
the
castle
until
Fontainebleau
become
the
most
extraordinary
of
France
royal
palaces
both
in
size
and
the
court
give
we
a
sense
of
the
lifestyle
here
what
be
the
lifestyle
of
the
king
in
Fontainebleau
it
may
come
as
a
surprise
but
during
the
Renaissance
Punto
the
french
court
--
the
Renaissance
period
like
a
french
court
be
nomadic
as
the
time
come
to
stop
there
be
no
property
nearby
the
king
would
sleep
under
a
tent
if
this
--
this
ballroom
give
we
a
great
sense
of
the
Renaissance
party
hold
here
banquet
Food
play
a
important
role
as
do
music
and
theater
when
we
go
to
the
king
gallery
we
see
the
emblem
of
a
salamander
can
you
tell
we
about
that
emblematic
of
all
the
renaissance
kings
have
a
emblem
some
even
have
more
than
one
for
Francis
the
salamander
have
special
meaning
it
be
a
mythical
animal
that
capture
the
imagination
because
it
be
suppose
to
be
able
to
survive
in
fire
even
to
feed
off
flame
and
put
they
out
that
be
what
make
the
salamander
a
very
potent
symbol
that
the
king
associates
with
I
nourish
and
extinguish
a
motto
go
to
the
notion
of
extinction
of
the
salamander
there
be
a
edict
write
here
in
Fontainebleau
on
the
persecution
of
protester
tell
we
about
that
initially
the
king
sister
be
interested
in
the
protestant
movement
in
the
Royal
Circle
one
could
imagine
the
king
and
he
court
be
about
to
convert
Francis
I
also
find
protestantism
useful
at
the
start
of
he
reign
spark
anarchy
in
the
state
of
he
rival
Charles
by
the
end
of
the
15
30
and
15
40
he
understand
the
protestant
movement
be
create
rebellion
and
discord
among
he
subject
he
can
not
accept
that
by
the
end
of
he
reign
he
response
to
protestantism
have
turn
into
repression
as
we
have
see
the
reign
of
King
Francis
both
militarily
and
diplomatically
be
a
mixed
tag
of
success
and
failure
eight
month
into
he
reign
the
king
night
win
a
key
battle
in
September
15
15
he
oust
he
swiss
enemy
and
capture
the
city
state
of
Malan
a
temporary
victory
that
remain
in
history
book
here
be
why
it
be
one
of
the
most
iconic
battle
in
french
history
yet
many
can
only
remember
the
day
--
do
it
ring
a
bell
of
course

who
it
be
against
you
have
get
I
there
many
fact
have

the
battle
take
place
in
a
field
15
kilometer
southeast

at
the
time
the
holy
roman
empire
control
a
swath
of
territory
range
from
the
north
of
Germany
to
the
Mediterranean
King
Francis
want
to
conquer
the
rich
country
of
Milan
along
with
the
niche
and
ally
french
troops
cast
with
mercenary
and
declare
bloody
victory
that
leave
ten
of
thousand
dead
but
there
be
another
reason
the
battle
be
remembered
today
a
hint
of
which
can
be
find
on
king
Francis
grave
in
the
basilica
of
San

knee
--
it
be
one
of
the
first
times
in
French
Hillary
--
in
french
history
that
these
be
use
in
battle
on
the
leave
you
have
the
more
traditional
image
of
the
monarch
lead
the
charge

the
difference

thing
that
could
be
controversial
while
at
the
same
time
make
sure
he
do
not
alienate
democratic
and
independent
voter
come
November
if
he
be
serious
about
elect
in
the
nomine
he
have
to
find
way
to
be
less
controversial
to
appeal
to
a
broader
section
of
the
public
can
he
do
it
I
do
not
know
no
one
know
at
this
point
but
it
be
clear
as

this

the
little
robot
on

that
can
recline
wall
that

be
the

if

to
two

wall
enable
the
bot
to
move
from

environment
it
also
open
up
a
realm
of
consumer
product
to
the
magic

but
what

it
cost
that
be
the
question
the
million-dollar
question
you
can

the
propeller

a
similar

a
major
incident
what
we
confirm
from
the
hospital
who
be
coordinate
and
work
together
with
the
israeli
police
I
be
about
to
bring
in
r
himself
service
that
make
you
it
a
New
Hampshire
there
be
heighten
security
throughout
Tel
Aviv
and
Jerusalem
but
this
morning
in
time
it
important
whether
we
Rosenfeld
it
be
cal
Perry
here
I
know
the
situation
be
unfoilede
I
be
wonder
if
there
be
anything
we
can
tell
by
the
fact
that
the
gunman
do
flee
do
that
indicate
perhaps
that
this
be
terror
related
or
be
it
just
simply
too
soon
to
tell
no
that
be
not
clear
a
terrorist
attack
can
be
a
we
have
have
attack
of
shot
be
fire
and
we
have
have
criminal
--
that
be
what
we
police
unit
be
try
to
there
be
early
initial
report
that
somebody
be
detain
at
the
scene
be
it
clear
in
that
person
be
involve
in
the
shooting
can
they
be
until
this
moment
in
time
they
be
not
connect
that
be
why
a
wide
search
be
continue
across
Tel
Aviv
in
order
to
understand
exactly
what
we
be
deal
with
and
at
the
moment
the
message
to
the
public
be
anybody
who
do
not
need
to
be
outside
in
the
main
area
give
osh
the
nearby
a
question
about
that
particular
neighborhood
can
you
describe
how
it
be
different
from
other
part
of
Tel
Aviv
and
incident
in
the
past
that
may
not
have
and
and
the
frequency
there
that
be
why
it
be
important
we
make
sure
the
different
area
be
cordon
off
we
have
map
och
the
area
to
find
which
be
more
likely
for
someone
to
have
it
be
early
on
as
you
have
say
you
be
mention
the
incident
in
Jerusalem
and
because
of
those
incident
you
preparation
in
tell
vich
any
conversation
sfchlt
you
need
to
find
out
and
understand
if
we
be
talk
about
a
terrorist
attack
if
it
be
a
terrorist
attack
it
will
investigate
in
one
direction
you
have
to
understand
who
the
attacker
be
and
if
it
be
connect
to
any
recent
incident
that
have
take
place
in
other
part
of
the
West
Bank
or
Jum
and
that
will
lead
we
because
it
be
not
just
continue
to
work
Cal
Perry
here
again
I
just
want
to
pick
up
what
be
happen
here
if
you
can
help
I
explain
to
we
viewer
this
street
be
a
very
busy
street
I
would
imagine
there
be
probably
off-duty
soldier
there
enjoy
they
Friday
afternoon
that
have
to
come
time
be
go
to
be
that
much
paster
we
be
talk
about
a
we
be
talk
about
geographic
and
a
relatively
small
area
all
of
we
unit
be
on
the
scene
include
medical
and
emergency
unit
at
this
moment
in
time
we
be
use
the
different
teens
to
focus
in
the
different
neighborhood
and
search
literally
by
little
I
do
not
want
to
you
even
though
you
do
not
know
what
the
motive
be
on
this
attack
have
there
be
any
discussion
increase
security
along
checkpoint
lead
in
and
out
of
the
West
Bank
we
have
to
put
thing
in
proportion
and
understand
at
this
moment
in
time
it
be
significant
and
the
most
important
thing
be
for
the
police
to
understand
if
we
be
talk
about
a
terrorism
incident
we
be
we
will
understand
whether
it
be
a
terrorist
rein
each
different
direction
would
I
could
anyone
from
the
family
and
organize
crime
that
be
a
different
area
all
together
we
have
to
wait
patiently
intensively
and
the
message
to
the
public
be
at
the
moment
who
ever
do
not
need
to
be
outside

should
say
the
bavarian
Interior
Ministry
praise
authority
for
the
way
they
act
so
swiftly
and
calmly
in
clear
these
station
to
prevent
what
they
think
be
a
imminent
attack
at
this
point
so
they
will
continue
investigate
the
name
to
see
if
these
people
be
in
Germany
or
be
in
fact
real
but
they
say
the
imminent
threat
be
no
longer
and
thing
be
back
to
the
previous
level
Frances
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
this
investigation
lead
to
any
arrest
there
thank
you
Chapman
Bell
for
the
update
what
go
into
consider
whether
they
be
go
to
actually
do
this
and
have
to
evacuate
two
train
station
at
that
time
I
think
you
just
hear
something
as
specific
as
time
and
location
in
this
case
I
have
to
emergency
something
more
come
up
late
it
be
nothing
new
to
expect
that
there
be
go
to
be
attack
or
plot
against
western
city
especially
on
new
year
eve
every
city
in
the
west
every
major
city
in
the
West
be
on
alert
for
it
so
for
authority
to
move
in
at
such
a
late
hour
be
extraordinary
it
be
something
they
know
would
cause
alarm
in
the
media
and
would
cause
alarm
in
the
media
whatever
it
be
it
be
worth
it
to
get
people
out
of
those
station
it
be
also
get
to
speak
to
the
intelligence
there
the
bavarian
interior
minister
say
they
get
the
report
from
a
friendly
intelligence
service
be
that
better
intelligence
gathering
and
the
communication
in
pass
that
on
yes
so
this
be
the
new
era
play
out
as
we
be
tell
especially
after
Paris
when
Americans
say
they
would
be
share
more
intelligence
with
the
french
and
with
other
western
source
and
really
focus
on
these
threat
to
the
city
this
be
something
completely
different
than
when
we
talk
about
the
older
day
of
the
Iraq
war
try
to
track
these
network
or
whether
there
be
individual
like
this
guy
up
in
Rochester
that
we
hear
about
yesterday
who
be
hardly
a
terrorist
more
like
a
real
wanna-be
or
something
much
more
sophisticated
like
Paris
that
turn
out
do
have
connection
back
to
some
isis
level
commander
who
be
really
plot
design
on
external
attack
this
be
something
we
be
just
go
to
hear
more
and
more
about
Kevin
Baron
thank
you
for
you
perspective
on
the
new
year
morning
wish
I
have
better
news
still
ahead
out
of
Tel
Aviv
a
shooting
that
have
leave
at
least
two
people
dead
and
several
injury
the
gunman
be
on
the
loose
we
will
follow
this
and
bring
you
more
on
MSNBC
live
ok
we
be
here
here
dad
mom
the
twin
Aunt
Alice

do
not
tell
I
aunt
Alice
be
come
of
course
do
not
forget
grandpa

the
test

maybe
just
head
back
to
the
dealership
do
not
you
want
to
meet
my
family
yep
totally
it
be
practically

but
we
still
need
you
signature

Volkswagen

at
signing
zero
down
zero
deposit
and
zero
first
month
payment
on
a
new
jetta
and
other
select
model
turn
to
the
latest
on
the
massive
fire
that
ungulf
a
high
rise
in
Dubai
there
be
cloud
of
smoke
billow
from
the
63
story
building
consume
more
than
20
hour
just
hour
before
ring
in
the
new
year
the
hotel
guest
and
staffer
evacuate
by
midnight
firefighter
be
still
battle
the
flame
but
a
firework
display
schedule
to
take
place
near
still
go
on
and
like
most
of
the
world
major
city
Dubai
have
be
on
high
alert
for
possible
terror
attack
but
so
far
there
have
be
no
indication
of
terrorism
involve
official
say
14
people
suffer
minor
injury
in
the
fire
I
want
to
bring
in
Bobby
Halton
editor
and
chief
at
fire
engineer
magazine
he
be
a
retired
fire
chief
we
see
that
video
we
know
the
scale
of
this
blaze
here
and
know
that
14
people
be
only
hurt
with
minor
injury
no
fatality
what
be
you
assessment
of
how
official
handle
the
fire
I
think
it
handle
it
well
basically
it
look
like
a
exterior
fire
probably
the
cladding
and
in
country
such
as
Dubai
be
allow
here
in
the
we
do
not
particularly
see
fire
like
this
because
we
code
and
we
testing
system
particularly
nfpa
285
preclude
people
from
use
these
type
of
material
interestingly
enough
there
be
a
huge
push
to
start
allow
these
material
because
of
they
insulate
capability
but
we
have
see
a
lot
of
these
fire
in
Dubai
they
have
have
two
just
recently
most
recently
in
April
when
you
see
this
video
it
look
like
just
a
huge
massive
torch
from
the
side
of
the
building
but
as
far
as
the
strategy
here
of
how
to
tackle
it
how
to
fight
it
this
be
20
floor
up
and
I
know
there
be
some
you
know
consideration
if
it
be
go
to
tackle
through
the
air
or
how
do
you
manage
that
and
know
what
be
the
best
place
to
start
in
tackle
fire
always
at
the
source
so
here
in
the
state
we
would
have
get
some
ground
unit
fast
apply
water
from
the
ground
to
the
floor
of
origin
which
in
this
building
be
209th
floor
the
fire
last
year
in
Dubai
start
on
the
50th
floor
which
would
have
preclude
that
type
of
tactic
but
most
of
the
fire
be
where
the
polyurethane
product
be
allow
there
only
14
people
hurt
no
one
strand
no
story
or
report
of
people
have
to
be
rescue
do
that
kind
of
surprise
you
when
you
be
see
this
and
watch
this
unfold
know
everyone
be
able
to
evacuate
and
the
hotel
it
be
not
at
full
okay
pansy
I
have
hear
report
it
be
about
30
%
so
not
as
many
people
as
if
it
have
be
100
%
and
the
time
it
occur
most
people
be
awake
because
of
the
holiday
festivity
and
the
fact
that
the
alarm
system
as
I
have
hear
do
activate
and
people
move
quickly
they
do
not
ignore
it
they
take
action
immediately
all
right
Bobby
Halton

you

the
perspective

a
Subaru
closely
watch
that
break
news
out
of
Israel
where
a
manhunt
be
under
way
after
police
say
a
gunman
open
fire
at
a
bar
in
Tel
Aviv
kill
two
people
and
injure
several
more
that
investigation
and
manhunt
under
way
it
be
in
the
afternoon
there
it
be
not
immediately
clear
who
be
behind
the
attack
I
understand
the
gunman
be
on
the
run
I
appreciate
you
be
with
I
Cal
you
be
speak
with
law
enforcement
from
Tel
Aviv
earlier
this
morning
and
there
be
a
lot
he
could
not
answer
because
it
be
yet
to
be
determine
whether
this
be
terrorist
or
criminal
and
I
do
not
think
they
want
to
say
until
of
course
they
be
absolutely
sure
the
manhunt
be
still
under
way
people
be
go
house
to
house
apartment
by
apartment
in
central
Tel
Aviv
this
would
be
a
seclusion
if
it
be
terror
related
that
be
why
official
be
not
willing
to
say
yet
whether
or
not
it
be
we
have
see
in
the
past
few
month
a
steady
drum
beat
of
violence
between
Palestinians
and
Israelis
but
it
be
take
the
form
of
stabbing
and
car
ramming
this
be
not
new
for
Tel
Aviv
but
we
have
not
see
this
recently
in
Tel
Aviv
new
year
day
around
this
area
as
we
can
receive
here
from
this
live
area
we
now
understand
from
official
it
be
a
assault
rifle
in
Tel
Aviv
this
be
a
very
popular
area
full
of
bar
full
of
cafe
and
this
be
shortly
before
shabbat
Holly
Day
in
Judaism
we
ask
the
spokesperson
the
foreign
press
spokesperson
if
that
help
and
he
say
of
course
this
be
Israel
and
you
would
have
have
people
get
ready
for
shabbat
but
in
this
day
in
page
people
look
over
they
back
be
vigilant
but
at
the
same
time
it
be
new
year
day
maybe
it
be
scale
back
a
little
bit
as
far
as
people
not
really
expect
something
like
this
yet
this
gun
pawn
come
out
and
take
off
still
out
there
that
be
one
of
the
thing
that
do
not
really
make
sense
yet
and
possibly
would
not
indicate
this
be
not
a
terrorist
attack
right
we
do
not
normally
see
palestinian
gunman
flee
the
scene
that
be
not
typical
but
again
very
early
too
soon
to
tell
as
you
say
this
be
Tel
Aviv
it
be
not
a
West
Bank
city
it
be
not
Jerusalem
this
be
Tel
Aviv
where
people
would
you
would
hope
feel
safe
and
this
community
still
very
much
on
edge
know
the
gunman
be
still
out
there
there
be
some
waterfront
area
investigator
be
look
around
as
well
I
can
imagine
would
many
business
be
close
be
there
lockdown
situation
around
there
now
the
central
area
of
the
city
be
on
kind
of
a
lockdown
the
israeli
police
be
very
good
at
this
they
have
unfortunately
have
a
lot
of
experience
in
do
this
they
know
what
they
be
do
they
cordon
off
area
we
have
see
video
on
the
ground
of
these
police
go
apartment
by
apartment
and
again
this
be
Israel
so
there
be
go
to
be
a
lot
of
citizen
out
there
help
the
police
in
they
search
we
understand
that
be
all
happen
especially
give
the
sensitively
to
try
lens
in
this
area
let
talk
more
with
Aaron
David
Miller
now
we
be
talk
about
a
gunman
but
I
be
sure
authority
be
look
to
see
if
he
be
the
only
one
who
act
or
if
he
be
work
in
concert
with
anybody
else
against
the
pattern
of
atax
that
begin
in
early
October
you
have
have
20
Israelis
kill
and
about
120
Palestinians
kill
largely
by
palestinian
youth
from
area
low
tech
a
few
weapon
use
particularly
in
the
West
Bank
whether
this
have
all
the
hall
mark
of
a
terrorist
attack
be
unclear
a
guy
flee
the
scene
it
seem
it
be
not
a
indication
of
anything
this
be
clearly
not
a
suicide
ait
could
be
relate
to
the
arab-israeli
conflict
or
it
could
be
a
Israel
or
a
personal
grudge
it
be
not
clear
one
thing
be
clear
if
it
be
related
to
the
israeli
palestinian
issue
we
be
in
for
a
rough
year
in
2016
which
be
likely
to
be
no
better
than
2015
give
that
when
would
you
expect
for
they
to
speak
out
for
a
motive
to
be
know
at
that
point
especially
in
that
be
the
message
again
not
know
if
this
be
a
response
to
those
tension
or
if
it
be
terror
related
or
criminal
related
I
think
the
Israelis
will
be
extremely
careful
they
have
have
a
long
and
violent
history
they
be
clearly
professional
they
do
not
want
to
create
panic
clearly
the
main
objective
be
to
secure
the
gunman
to
ensure
there
be
no
at
least
of
what
the
Israelis
be
speculate
the
Israeli
press
will
be
all
over
this
this
be
the
first
attack
in
Tel
Aviv
since
November
4th
this
be
more
low-tech
violence
two
people
be
stab
I
believe
one
fatally
on
a
Tel
Aviv
beach
give
that
you
be
talk
they
low
tech
attack
what
need
to
be
consider
know
the
gunman
be
still
out
there
as
far
as
release
information
that
may
not
tip
this
person
off
in
know
how
they
be
try
to
go
about
capture
he
I
just
think
it
be
systemic
police
work
and
counterterrorism
there
be
tremendous
authority
in
expertise
ton
this
one
I
suspect
that
within
the
next
several
hour
there
be
a
reasonable
chance
that
even
though
this
be
a
densely
populated
area
I
know
this
area
and
likely
they
will
I
think
apprehend
this
person
or
person
and
I
be
sure
that
be
the
hope
with
the
public
there
the
community
there
as
nightfall
be
come
in
a
few
hour
Cal
Perry
and
Aaron
David
Miller
thank
you
at
least
two
dead
several
wound
in
a
shooting
in
Tel
Aviv
with
a
gunman
on
the
run
now
to
the
the
big
dechlt
in
the
cosby
case
he
wife
could
be
force
to
testify
against
he
a
federal
court
judge
deny
a
motion
that
would
have
keep
cosby
wife
Camille
from
GAFG
deposition
next
week
in
another
case
a
civil
suit
against
she
husband
late
yesterday
a
federal
judge
in
Massachusetts
rule
Camille
Cosby
testimony
be
relevant
because
she
also
serve
as
she
husband
business
manager
join
I
now
from
Los
Angeles
be
criminal
defense
attorney
Thomas
Meszaros
you
have
the
situation
that
Camille
Cosby
who
have
stand
by
she
husband
but
also
Camille
Cosby
in
the
role
as
he
business
manager
well
you
have
a
criminal
case
and
a
bunch
of
civil
case
and
coordinate
all
of
they
be
not
go
to
be
easy
pip
suspect
at
that
at
some
point
the
civil
case
be
go
to
be
stay
mean
they
be
go
to
be
freeze
until
the
criminal
case
in
Pennsylvania
be
involve
that
happen
most
of
the
time
you
also
have
the
spousal
privilege
which
April
lous
a
spouse
to
refuse
to
testify
to
conversation
between
the
spouse
and
the
other
spouse
as
you
indicate
it
be
complicate
by
the
fact
that
she
be
he
business
manager
but
I
think
there
be
go
to
be
a
lot
of
litigation
as
to
what
be
protected
and
what
be
not
as
far
as
bill
Cosby
he
camp
he
attorney
what
be
the
effort
on
they
part
if
any
know
that
she
may
be
testify
or
give
a
deposition
in
civil
case
can
you
do
deposition
you
normally
can
not
do
in
criminal
case
sometimes
criminal
lawyer
like
the
fact
that
there
be
a
parallel
civil
case
because
they
can
get
some
information
through
deposition
that
normally
be
not
available
to
they
on
the
other
hand
if
they
do
that
Cosby
may
be
force
to
testify
at
a
deposition
and
assert
he
fifth
amendment
privilege
because
the
criminal
case
be
go
on
what
he
spouse
can
do
I
think
be
go
to
be
heavily
litigate
because
she
have
a
right
not
to
testify
to
confident
communication
between
she
and
she
husband
on
the
other
hand
as
he
business
manager
there
may
be
a
set
of
issue
which
a
judge
will
decide
be
not
confidential
because
they
go
beyond
spousal
communication
into
the
realm
of
unprotected
unprivileged
business
discussion
fascinating
issue
it
be
fascinating
especially
when
you
weigh
in
Camille
Cosby
lawyer
and
they
word
in
use
this
when
the
lawyer
call
the
subpoena
for
she
testimony
call
this
a
fishing
expedition
argue
she
potential
knowledge
of
Crosby
sexual
proclivity
be
irrelevant
to
the
case
that
be
the
argument
why
do
it
fall
short
I
think
it
be
stretch
thing
to
talk
to
a
spouse
who
have
a
right
to
have
confidential
discussion
with
she
spouse
to
go
into
she
knowledge
of
he
sex
life
I
think
be
way
over
the
Paille
I
think
to
call
that
relevant
would
get
into
the
ril
many
of
fictional
discussion
the
fact
that
a
judge
decide
to
rule
this
out
of
bound
be
appropriate
certainly
a
lot
of
layer
of
this
case
to
watch
Thomas
thank
you
thanks
for
have
I
come
up
a
major
shake-up
in
Ben
Carson
campaign
with
at
least
three
top
aide

just
before
a
month
before
the
Iowa
Caucus
these
be
my
dog
dusty
and
Cooper
I
work
for
the
dog
twenty-four
seven
I
be
the
Butler
these
dog
shed
like
crazy
it
be
like
be
inside
of
a
snow
globe
it
take
a
awful
lot
of
time
to
keep
the
house
clean
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
what
be
this
swiffer
sweeper
and
duster
this
be
nice
and
easy
boy
it
really
stick
to
it
it
fit
in
all
of
the
tight
space
this
be
really
great
do
that
look
familiar
to
you
I
be
no
longer
the
Butler
I
be
just
one
of
the
guy
now
to
some
big
political
news
on
this
new
year
morning
one
month
to
the
day
to
the
Iowa
Caucus
several
of
Ben
Carson
top
staff
have
quit
the
shake-up
follow
a
sharp
decline
in
the
poll
for
the
one-time
front-runner
the
frustration
have
just
be
build
with
these
internal
conflict
and
I
just
could
not
do
it
anymore
what
internal
conflict
some
of
he
adviser
just
you
know
have
get
he
to
do
some
thing
that
be
not
very
smart
chaos
be
not
a
bad
thing
dissension
be
not
bad
as
long
as
the
candidate
come
out
better
more
well
prepared
and
ready
for
this
battle
that
be
ahead
there
be
a
new
carson
emerge
and
you
and
other
will
see
it
soon
Carson
himself
be
call
this
a
new
phase
of
he
run
for
the
White
House
say
it
be
net
to
invigorate
my
campaign
with
a
strategy
that
more
aggressively
share
my
vision
and
world
view
join
I
be
Jane
Tem
and
to
both
of
you
happy
new
year
not
the
best
of
start
for
Ben
Carson
cam
many
here
Jane
I
want
to
ask
you
not
necessarily
staffer
versus
Ben
Carson
it
be
staffer
versus
staffer
we
be
talk
about
high-tier
staffer
what
do
it
say
with
this
infighting
about
the
instability
in
the
campaign
I
think
the
candidate
look
like
he
be
not
in
control
of
what
be
go
on
they
be
tell
I
it
be
normal
and
it
sound
like
the
decision
be
make
by
Ben
Carson
by
some
of
he
top
staffer
these
be
long-time
political
aide
bring
that
political
credibility
to
a
candidate
who
come
from
the
outside
while
you
see
Armstrong
Williams
say
this
be
a
different
kind
of
Carson
Iowaans
want
someone
who
can
win
Bob
I
understand
he
be
get
money
he
be
get
the
money
there
it
be
just
a
matter
of
the
foundation
and
the
structure
of
those
to
be
able
to
know
where
to
spend
it
to
help
he
win
and
give
back
what
he
be
lose
be
this
the
start
of
the
crumble
lot
of
money
be
come
in
but
they
be
burn
through
it
really
really
fast
there
be
be
quite
a
bit
of
money
that
have
be
spend
on
raise
the
money
the
figure
we
get
be
just
of
the
collection
of
it
but
beyond
that
there
be
just
be
a
feeling
that
the
campaign
and
Ben
Carson
be
not
really
in
sync
now
the
problem
always
be
that
you
always
have
the
long-time
friend
and
then
you
have
the
political
pro
and
they
sometimes
can
crash
together
and
it
look
like
they
have
do
now
the
man
who
be
replace
the
top
of
the
it
be
go
to
be
interesting
to
see
if
he
can
translate
he
military
experience
into
the
political
world
I
know
from
some
of
you
source
we
be
report
on
these
top
three
but
there
could
be
a
domino
effect
right
we
hear
there
be
two
more
staffer
who
have
they
say
they
would
get
back
to
we
they
could
not
tell
we
how
many
people
be
still
employ
by
this
cap
cam
be
pain
it
be
interesting
to
see
what
he
will
actually
say
give
if
he
do
not
have
at
least
a
respectable
showing
when
it
come
to
the
stronghold
of
Iowa
with
the
evangelical
what
if
that
do
not
happen
a
month
today
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
key
point
that
you
just
make
and
Jane
make
earlier
be
that
we
be
just
30
day
away
from
the
caucus
in
effect
he
be
restart
it
be
go
to
be
very
interesting
to
see
if
he
can
take
he
and
Odi
if
he
do
not
do
well
it
will
continue
to
take
the
wind
out
of
the
sail
of
he
campaign
great
see
you
happy
new
year
to
good
to
you

new
information
in
the
break
news
out
of
Tel
Aviv
at
this
hour
a
manhunt
under
way
after
this
a
Friday
afternoon
shooting
outside
a
popular
bar
in
a
busy
part
of
the
city
there
you
see
at
one
point
in
this
video
capture
at
the
very
moment
of
the
attack
part
of
the
gun
there
involve
in
the
shooting
and
the
people
there
run
for
cover
we
know
at
least
--
there
it
be
the
gun
on
the
right
side
there
from
that
window
again
this
video
just
come
in
to
MSNBC
we
understand
that
two
people
have
be
kill
in
this
shooting
several
people
hurt
some
critically
as
investigator
in
Tel
Aviv
be
search
for
the
gunman
and
again
that
video
of
that
very
very
moment
of
this
shooting
also
get
new
information
from
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
it
have
not
be
know
the
motive
of
this
shooting
whether
it
be
criminal
whether
it
be
terrorist
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
tell
reporter
at
the
scene
there
as
they
be
search
for
the
shooter
that
the
shooting
appear
to
be
a
terrorist
attack
this
happen
on
January
1st
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
a
Friday
afternoon
local
time
there
in
Tel
Aviv
a
area
already
sensitive
to
violence
in
the
area
with
I
now
be
MSNBC
Cal
parry
as
we
continue
to
watch
this
and
really
how
brazen
this
be
and
again
a
busy
area
a
cafe
and
again
in
that
video
you
see
the
arm
come
out
extend
with
the
gun
again
right
there
and
what
we
know
report
of
the
gunman
wear
black
flee
the
scene
and
be
now
nowhere
to
be
find
yeah
so
this
just
shortly
before
local
time
on
DIZINGHOFF
street
in
Tel
Aviv
you
can
see
the
pub
the
cafe
very
crowd
shortly
after
that
moment
the
gunman
take
off
down
the
street
accord
to
israeli
police
and
down
a
side
alley
and
that
be
why
we
be
now
see
hundred
of
israeli
anti-terror
police
go
house
to
house
apartment
by
apartment
in
Tel
Aviv
look
for
the
gunman
as
you
say
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
have
call
this
a
terrorist
attack
we
be
go
to
have
to
wait
and
hear
from
official
higher
in
the
israeli
government
because
if
this
be
a
terror
attack
it
will
certainly
be
see
as
a
escalation
the
back-and-forth
violence
we
have
see
recently
have
not
be
brazen
like
this
it
have
be
more
low-grade
conflict
but
again
certainly
a
terrifying
attack
but
how
it
be
label
by
israeli
official
will
be
very
important
go
forward
not
only
to
people
across
Israel
but
certainly
for
the
Palestinians
live
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
absolutely
alarming
on
several
front
there
know
that
the
gunman
be
out
there
certainly
a
community
the
public
on
edge
know
that
they
have
not
find
he
also
the
mayor
say
that
this
be
a
terrorist
attack
and
the
question
--
do
he
act
alone
do
he
act
with
the
help
of
other
and
if
so
be
there
other
still
out
there
as
well
and
how
do
he
get
away
so
quickly
that
be
go
to
be
one
of
the
thing
that
the
israeli
official
be
go
to
be
look
at
because
it
would
indicate
that
he
do
have
help
the
Israelis
again
and
we
have
be
say
this
throughout
the
morning
be
very
good
at
this
unfortunately
they
have
deal
with
this
a
lot
so
they
be
good
at
shut
down
part
of
the
city
and
do
the
house-to-house
search
they
will
also
I
be
quite
sure
increase
security
along
those
checkpoint
in
the
West
Bank
in
the
chance
that
this
be
a
palestinian
terrorist
they
will
not
want
that
person
be
able
to
get
anywhere
but
in
any
situation
when
there
be
a
gunman
and
there
be
a
gunman
on
the
loose
and
there
be
a
search
for
he
it
be
very
sensitive
especially
with
the
media
coverage
locally
globally
not
tip
off
this
person
as
far
as
the
investigator
and
law
enforcement
strategy
in
try
to
find
he
and
israeli
television
be
be
very
careful
not
to
broadcast
live
picture
from
any
sort
of
single
location
in
Tel
Aviv
as
these
search
sort
of
continue
because
as
you
be
allude
to
you
would
not
want
that
gunman
to
flip
on
the
tv
and
have
any
indication
of
what
be
go
on
with
these
search
now
this
as
MSNBC
be
get
this
new
video
on
the
left
side
of
you
screen
there
show
the
moment
of

on
this
new

day
I
be
Frances
Rivera
and
we
begin
this
hour
with
break
news
out
of
Tel

where
a
manhunt
be
under

a
popular

kill
at
least
two
people
and
injure
several
more
this
be

the
very
moment

all

also
the
latest

the

Tel

say
that
this
be
a
terrorist
attack

Cal

I
here

what
more
be
the
mayor
say
as
he
be
make
this
announcement
that
he
believe
this
be
a
terrorist
attack
well
I
think
we
will
have
to
wait
for
further
confirmation
on
that
as
they
continually
search
for
this
suspect
as
you
say
he
be
still
on
the
loose
so
until
they
find
he
to
know
exact
motive
be
unclear
however
the
mayor
have
say
this
but
go
back
to
this
video
of
the
attack
Mickey
Rosenfeld
who
be
the
israeli
foreign
press
spokesperson
he
confirm
this
be

this
man
dress
in
black
as
eyewitness
say
walk
up

a
gun

start
firing

a
number
of
seconds
we
understand
that
two

as
many
as
seven
other

from
the

two
of
they

they
be
comb
the

try

that

be
safe
they
have
specialist
unit
out
there

comb
the
street
go
door
to
door
try
to
locate
this
person
who
be
you
know
clearly
in
this
video
shooting
what
appear
to
be
indiscriminately
at
these
people
dine
outside
of
a
bar
in
Tel
Aviv
as
you
know
Tel
Aviv
and
Israel
be
not
--
they
be
almost
use
to
I
guess
terror
attack
however
we
need
to
first
confirm
that
this
be
a
terrorist
incident
although
the
mayor
call
it
that
we
will
wait
and
see
what
authority
say
as
more
information
come
out
and
as
they
continue
they
search
for
this
suspect
Frances
Chapman
Bell
thanks
for
that
report
join
I
here
in
studio
be
MSNBC
CAL
parry
CAL
as
we
be
watch
this
and
see
it
be
one
thing
to
have
this
deadly
shooting
happen
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
in
a
very
busy
area
in
a
public
place
a
restaurant
when
all
these
people
be
dine
enjoy
the
first
day
of
the
new
year
but
also
the
tension
that
still
exist
know
the
gunman
be
still
out
there
and
they
be
go
building
to
building
door
to
door
I
can
imagine
with
some
lockdown
possibly
in
some
area
too
try
to
find
the
guy
yeah
significant
lockdown
and
as
you
look
at
that
video
and
on
the
left
side
of
you
screen
you
have
the
shooting
on
the
right
side
of
the
screen
you
will
notice
you
have
anti-terror
police
border
police
border
security
you
also
have
israeli
soldier
who
be
off
on
they
Friday
afternoon
let
keep
in
mind
on
Friday
afternoon
Friday
evening
it
become
shibon
in
Israel
that
be
the
holy
day
so
people
would
have
be
out
on
the
busy
street
street
would
have
be
pack
that
will
actually
help
with
the
search
that
will
help
israeli
official
carry
out
the
search
because
again
you
will
have
off-duty
member
of
the
Israeli
army
there
on
the
scene
already
again
we
have
the
mayor
sort
of
tell
the
local
media
that
this
look
to
be
a
terror
attack
he
be
go
back
and
forth
on
this
we
stress
to
we
viewer
very
early
in
this
very
early
and
they
do
not
have
the
gunman
yet
so
much
more
will
be
know
the
moment
that
gunman
be
located
and
again
it
be
very
important
how
the
israeli
government
classify
this
if
they
call
it
a
terror
attack
it
would
be
see
as
a
escalation
and
that
be
what
I
be
curious
about
so
the
mayor
you
would
think
would
know
that
and
would
be
sensitive
and
again
we
do
not
know
what
evidence
that
he
be
be
present
we
do
not
know
what
he
know
some
detail
that
we
as
the
press
the
public
know
at
this
point
but
I
would
think
they
would
be
very
cautious
give
the
fact
that
we
be
just
a
few
hour
in
from
this
shooting
with
the
gunman
still
out
there
in
classify
it
as
a
terrorist
attack
they
be
be
very
cautious
the
israeli
government
be
be
incredibly
cautious
in
how
they
phrase
this
how
they
present
it
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
frankly
have
a
couple
of
dozen
tv
camera
in
he
face
and
very
aggressive
reporter
and
he
be
be
go
back
and
forth
what
he
be
be
say
to
the
local
media
be
he
want
everyone
to
be
alert
to
stay
on
alert
he
do
not
want
to
rule
anything
out
and
that
make
sense
in
the
early
part
of
this
investigation
but
again
we
have
to
be
very
clear
how
we
classify
this
whether
it
be
terror
related
or
a
domestic
violence
incident
or
a
criminal
attack
for
whatever
reason
as
we
delve
into
this
also
know
you
have
a
area
where
people
be
on
edge
they
be
look
around
because
violence
be
kind
of
something
that
they
have
see
repeatedly
over
and
over
again
but
not
necessarily
something
like
this
not
necessarily
something
as
brazen
as
a
gun
we
have
see
it
with
knife
as
weapon
and
other
thing
but
talk
a
little
bit
about
how
this
may
be
different
from
other
attack
we
have
see
in
the
past
so
in
recent
month
what
we
have
see
in
the
conflict
be
a
low-grade
violent
conflict
the
Palestinians
have
be
lash
out
at
Israeli
security
force
use
knife
especially
in
the
West
Bank
use
car
to
ram
security
checkpoint
we
have
not
see
these
kind
of
brazen
attack
in
recent
month
suicide
bombing
seem
to
have
become
partly
a
thing
of
the
past
for
Israelis
a
lot
of
that
people
be
say
be
a
credit
to
that
security
fence
which
Palestinians
of
course
for
they
part
declare
a
humanitarian
nightmare
so
this
be
unusual
for
Tel
Aviv
now
certainly
during
the
second
intifada
in
previous
year
this
would
have
be
a
part
of
daily
life
but
if
this
be
terror-related
--
and
again
I
think
that
be
why
the
israeli
official
be
be
so
careful
not
to
call
it
terrorism
right
off
the
bat
--
this
will
have
huge
implication
in
the
conflict
it
will
be
see
as
a
escalation
and
more
than
that
the
israeli
public
will
demand
that
the
israeli
government
do
something
and
that
be
when
we
enter
back
into
this
tit
for
tat
--
and
the
whole
retaliation
that
may
come
as
a
result
when
we
talk
about
this
what
can
be
say
about
this
gunman
firing
as
we
have
see
in
that
video
two
people
kill
multiple
other
people
several
other
people
as
many
as
seven
injure
some
critically
and
those
customer
in
there
just
duck
fear
for
they
life
as
they
realize
what
be
actually
happen
and
then
this
gunman
run
he
flee
he
take
off
run
down
a
alley
very
quickly
unclear
if
he
have
help
that
be
go
to
be
very
very
key
to
this
investigation
whether
anyone
assist
he
in
get
away
and
the
fact
that
they
have
not
find
he
yet
be
a
little
bit
surprising
again
the
Israelis
be
very
very
good
at
this
they
have
be
through
this
before
they
security
force
be
well
train
to
react
very
quickly
to
cordon
off
a
area
shut
it
down
go
house
to
house
and
that
be
what
they
be
do
and
I
think
you
point
on
this
be
key
in
the
age
of
social
media
it
be
2016
now
the
way
that
the
local
israeli
media
cover
this
be
go
to
be
very
important
not
to
give
anything
away
not
to
give
anything
away
not
a
tip-off
to
the
gunman
as
far
as
where
police
be
look
that
may
help
they
but
that
be
also
interesting
too
once
they
find
he
how
that
may
end
whether
he
be
take
--
he
or
she
--
take
into
custody
peacefully
whether
there
be
some
sort
of
standoff
whether
there
may
be
a
violent
end
to
this
that
remain
to
be
see
so
again
more
tension
here
for
the
public
and
this
area
and
community
and
especially
for
people
who
be
live
in
that
part
of
Tel
Aviv
not
know
where
this
gunman
be
right
now
on
the
loose
and
israeli
police
be
again
tell
people
to
stay
inside
lock
they
apartment
do
not
go
out
let
the
police
do
they
job
so
certainly
a
unfold
and
terrifying
situation
give
we
some
perspective
on
this
area
here
certainly
a
busy
area
a
business
district
with
restaurant
residential
area
but
there
be
also
some
coastal
area
close
to
here
too
which
also
law
enforcement
be
look
into
as
a
possible
place
where
the
gunman
may
be
yeah
Tel
Aviv
be
a
beach
town
and
this
be
dizingoff
street
name
for
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
it
be
a
popular
area
lot
of
bar
restaurant
young
people
you
see
it
on
the
screen
it
be
not
far
from
the
beach
maybe
a
quarter
mile
from
the
beach
and
this
be
what
attract
young
people
in
Israel
on
a
Friday
afternoon
this
be
where
they
go
and
congregate
because
it
be
a
vibrant
scene
in
Israel
this
be
where
young
people
go
and
hang
out
so
the
timing
the
location
of
the
attack
very
key
very
interesting
especially
on
a
Friday
afternoon
we
should
not
forget
that
and
certainly
the
israeli
media
be
lead
with
that
this
attack
happen
just
before
shabab
and
nothing
leave
no
bomb
backpack
or
anything
as
well
as
anybody
who
may
have
be
help
the
gunman
and
you
see
that
on
the
right
the
forensic
team
yes
Cal
parry
thank
you
for
the
perspective
we
will
check
back
with
you
later
as
MSNBC
continue
to
follow
the
development
from
that
shooting
in
Tel
Aviv
turn
now
to
the
latest
from
Dubai
get
we
first
look
in
daylight
of
last
night
inferno
break
out
at
that
high-rise
hotel
just
hour
before
the
city
be
set
to
ring
in
the
new
year
with
a
firework
display
official
be
try
to
figure
out
what
cause
the
fire
to
engulf
the
63-story
building
on
new
year
eve
the
fire
start
around
local
time
at
one
of
the
city
most
upscale
hotel
fire
engulf
more
than
20
floor
the
hotel
guest
and
staff
be
evacuate
and
so
be
the
large
crowd
gather
downtown
for
a
new
year
celebration
and
by
midnight
firefighter
they
be
still
battle
the
flame
but
a
firework
display
schedule
to
take
place
nearby
the
world
tallest
building
still
go
on
like
most
of
the
world
major
city
Dubai
have
be
on
high
alert
for
possible
terror
attack
but
official
say
so
far
there
be
be
no
indication
of
terrorism
involve
official
say
14
people
be
injure
join
I
now
on
the
phone
former
New
York
City
Fire
Commissioner
Thomas
von
Essen
in
charge
of
the
department
at
the
time
of
the
September
11th
attack
thank
you
for
spend
you
new
year
morning
with
we
sir
as
we
look
into
this
and
you
consider
this
and
you
consider
the
scale
of
this
fire
how
massive
it
be
how
far
up
in
floor
it
be
what
be
you
assessment
of
how
Dubai
official
have
be
handle
this
especially
give
that
there
be
14
people
who
just
suffer
minor
injury
it
be
amazing
I
think
they
do
a
phenomenal
job
put
the
fire
out
interior
fire
be
difficult
but
put
out
fire
that
be
just
consume
the
outside
of
a
building
that
be
so
high
30
40
floor
of
fire
start
at
the
20th
floor
that
be
not
easy
and
I
think
probably
most
of
it
just
burn
itself
out
from
the
outside
but
the
inside
when
they
be
worry
about
people
be
trap
people
be
maybe
overcome
with
smoke
the
fire
burning
through
the
heat
break
those
window
and
get
inside
whether
or
not
the
sprinkler
system
be
work
whether
it
be
keep
up
with
it
all
the
people
that
might
be
need
help
inside
it
be
a
very
very
difficult
fire
operation
difficult
fire
help
also
by
the
hotel
I
understand
by
some
report
be
only
35
%
occupy
which
certainly
help
I
can
imagine
besides
the
priority
in
get
the
fire
out
fine
the
source
number
one
how
do
you
get
water
up
that
high
to
begin
with
well
you
want
to
bring
it
down
the
sprinkler
system
be
supply
by
water
up
on
top
and
then
they
start
pump
it
from
the
bottom
to
resupply
it
and
give
it
some
more
power
but
get
hose
to
the
fire
on
the
outside
of
the
building
to
such
a
degree
so
much
fire
and
all
of
the
thing
on
the
balcony
furniture
the
flammable
stuff
they
might
have
propane
barbecue
out
there
then
as
it
get
into
the
apartment
or
the
hotel
room
whichever
--
it
be
a
mixed-use
occupancy
so
it
be
just
a
enormous
difficulty
and
you
need
so
many
people
firefighter
to
conduct
the
search
put
the
fire
out
on
the
outside
and
they
be
worry
about
the
other
event
up
the
road
with
the
firework
it
be
I
be
sure
a
very
difficult
decision
for
the
person
that
have
to
make
it
whether
or
not
to
go
forward
with
firework
Sir
not
to
mention
also
the
concern
and
the
fear
for
many
of
the
people
already
downtown
we
have
see
in
that
video
so
much
of
the
fire
and
flame
of
debris
fall
down
to
the
street
below
I
be
sure
law
enforcement
involve
but
that
be
also
a
concern
in
make
sure
the
flame
and
the
fire
and
debris
do
not
hit
anybody
below
oh
absolutely
you
know
you
have
get
thousand
maybe
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
I
do
not
know
the
extent
of
the
crowd
that
they
get
but
the
police
be
all
usher
they
in
a
particular
direction
you
have
people
then
who
be
run
in
the
opposite
direction
to
get
away
from
debris
get
away
from
the
danger
so
it
be
a
enormous
difficult
operation
for
the
police
fire
all
the
civil
servant
that
be
there
I
be
sure
they
have
emergency
management
they
must
use
military
people
for
a
event
this
big
and
I
guess
that
help
they
also
the
fact
that
they
have
so
many
people
in
place
for
the
firework
display
that
they
be
able
to
use
those
folk
then
to
try
to
help
they
with
this
operation
and
the
debris
like
you
say
be
a
very
big
deal
because
all
that
stuff
that
you
can
see
it
just
blow
off
the
building
and
that
come
from
40
floor
up
if
you
get
hit
with
somebody
lawn
chair
or
table
you
know
it
will
kill
people
and
to
have
all
those
14
minor
injury
it
be
really
very
surprising
it
absolutely
be
certainly
what
strike

lot
of

mom-and-pop
business
whether

a
big
question

Charles
Hadlock
I
appreciate
it
sure
happy
new
year
to
you
I
want
to
bring
in
on
the
phone
Joseph
Fedderman
AP
Bureau
chief
for
Israel
this
as
we
be
follow
the
deadly
shooting
there
that
have
take
the
life
of
two
people
and
hurt
at
least
seven
with
that
gunman
on
the
loose
thank
you
for
be
with
I
what
more
be
we
hear
especially
with
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
come
out
a
short
time
ago
say
that
this
be
a
terrorist
attack
well
I
do
not
know
where
he
get
that
information
we
be
closely
in
touch
with
police
and
they
be
explore
two
theory
it
could
be
a
palestinian
attack
like
the
mayor
say
but
it
be
also
very
possible
that
this
be
some
sort
of
crime
or
mafia-type
hit
no
one
really
know
at
this
point
talk
a
little
bit
about
that
and
the
culture
of
organize
crime
in
Tel
Aviv
especially
when
you
see
something
like
this
we
be
look
at
the
video
the
portion
you
see
circle
--
what
we
be
show
here
be
video
that
MSNBC
have
of
the
moment
of
the
attack
with
the
gunman
actually
hold
up
the
gun
shot
be
fire
and
then
inside
the
restaurant
you
see
the
customer
run
hide
as
the
shooting
have
take
place
what
more
do
we
know
about
that
especially
with
some
of
that
underground
organized
crime
in
the
area
well
yeah
I
mean
this
be
a
issue
that
Israel
have
be
deal
with
for
many
year
it
do
not
always
make
international
headline
it
be
sort
of
a
local
story
but
it
be
something
even
a
few
day
ago
we
have
a
car
bombing
in
a
suburb
of
Tel
Aviv
you
have
these
thing
periodically
it
be
certainly
not
a
daily
occurrence
but
it
be
also
not
out
of
the
ordinary
in
general
these
attack
one
of
the
reason
it
do
not
attract
so
much
attention
be
because
these
guy
be
very
good
at
go
after
each
other
and
spare
the
general
public
so
they
kind
of
keep
it
in
house
otherwise
you
know
you
be
not
affect
by
it
you
know
I
do
not
know
what
video
you
be
look
at
because
I
can
not
see
you
screen
right
now
but
there
be
sort
of
a
amateur
cell
phone
video
that
be
be
float
around
where
you
see
this
gunman
outside
of
the
window
of
the
restaurant
be
that
--
you
be
describe
what
we
be
see
there
be
a
lot
of
reason
why
this
may
be
a
organize
hit
if
you
look
at
the
type
of
the
weapon
and
it
appear
that
he
know
who
he
be
go
after
you
see
somebody
on
the
ground
that
he
do
not
go
after
so
there
be
a
indication
that
he
know
who
the
target
be
it
be
sophisticated
I
have
speak
to
witness
the
way
the
guy
be
dress
he
be
disguise
he
have
glass
on
he
be
dress
in
black
he
have
a
getaway
plan
so
there
be
a
level
of
sophistication
here
that
would
lean
if
anything
toward
the
criminal
element
but
it
be
still
too
soon
to
say
let
talk
about
that
that
getaway
plan
as
again
law
enforcement
and
police
be
search
for
this
gunman
again
if
point
to
organize
crime
he
would
have
have
help
get
away
yeah
look
the
witness
I
have
speak
to
it
be
not
clear
where
he
get
to
he
flee
on
foot
and
disappear
very
quickly
so
right
now
the
police
be
search
the
area
it
be
very
possible
he
just
kind
of
bolt
into
a
building
and
be
hide
maybe
there
be
a
getaway
car
it
be
really
impossible
to
say
you
can
only
speculate
but
because
he
be
so
good
at
get
away
that
again
would
lean
toward
the
criminal
side
of
thing
and
I
be
sure
the
concern
for
police
there
as
well
as
the
public
as
well
as
people
who
be
out
there
on
a
Friday
night
now
as
nightfall
be
approach
be
how
this
will
end
whether
the
gunman
will
give
himself
up
whether
they
will
find
he
take
he
into
custody
peacefully
or
whether
it
will
be
violent
you
know
it
could
be
any
of
those
thing
the
israeli
police
be
usually
pretty
good
at
find
they
suspect
so
I
imagine
they
be
go
to
find
this
person
at
some
point
usually
sooner
than
later
you
know
but
the
atmosphere
right
now
in
Tel
Aviv
it
be
a
bit
tense
it
be
not
like
everybody
be
shutter
up
inside
of
they
house
I
have
be
in
touch
with
people
there
--
people
be
out
and
about
people
be
out
and
about
but
less
so
than
normal
partly
because
there
be
a
element
of
panic
I
think
people
be
a
little
bit
scared
and
partly
because
it
be
a
cold
winter
rainy
day
all
right
that
certainly
may
come
into
play

moment
of
the
attack
in

a

we
continue
to
watch
development
out
of
Munich
where
german
police
be
on
alert
after
get
what
the
police
chief
say
this
morning
be
a
concrete
tip
about
a
midnight
terror
attack
by
several
member
of
Isis
from
Syria
and
Iraq
two
train
station
be
evacuate
and
more
than
500
police
and
special
unit
officer
converge
on
Munich
want
to
bring
in
MSNBC
military
analyst
and
retire
four-star
Army
General
Barry
McCaffrey
General
I
appreciate
you
be
with
we
here
on
new
year
day
and
I
want
to
start
with
you
take
you
assessment
on
the
way
german
official
respond
to
this
threat
know
they
be
hour
away
from
the
celebration
to
ring
in
the
new
year
and
then
they
decide
that
they
would
evacuate
these
station
well
you
know
it
just
show
you
the
incredible
pressure
on
both
law
enforcement
intelligence
official
but
even
probably
more
importantly
on
political
leader
the
Germans
handle
in
my
view
handle
it
extremely
well
they
announce
what
they
have
to
they
take
discrete
measure
the
opposite
approach
be
in
Belgium
where
they
essentially
cancel
all
sort
of
activity
the
Los
Angeles
School
district
be
another
example
it
seem
to
I
how
you
do
not
respond
to
terrorist
threat
so
you
know
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
can
not
close
down
these
complex
modern
society
in
response
to
threat
even
when
they
be
credible
we
have
get
to
accentuate
though
we
ability
to
stand
behind
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
on
proactive
action
to
try
and
stop
these
attack
before
they
start
General
talk
about
how
difficult
that
be
though
I
can
imagine
in
weigh
the
fine
line
of
say
you
know
what
we
know
be
concrete
what
we
know
be
specific
and
we
need
to
act
accordingly
but
at
the
same
time
what
we
have
see
so
much
be
not
instil
fear
in
the
public
in
the
community
and
not
give
terrorist
exactly
what
they
want
oh
yeah
exactly
look
you
know
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
we
respond
every
time
spasmodiically
to
these
threat
they
will
attack
the
day
after
the
suppose
threat
day
so
I
think
again
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
real
solution
be
empower
the
FBI
and
customs
and
border
protection
in
the
United
States
to
keep
these
people
out
of
the
country
take
aggressive
muscular
action
against
terrorist
isis
figure
in
Iraq
and
Syria
but
also
make
sure
that
we
allow
the
National
Security
Agency
and
other
domestic
intelligence
collection
to
identify
the
threat
before
they
occur
FBI
be
terrific
it
seem
to
I
in
protect
we
in
this
manner
well
I
want
to
get
you
take
on
that
especially
give
when
the
start
of
the
new
year
we
have
end
2015
with
of
course
Paris
on
the
mind
of
many
but
many
of
these
possible
attack
thwart
in
Belgium
we
have
see
arrest
from
the
potential
terrorist
as
well
and
even
as
close
here
as
Rochester
New
York
so
what
be
you
take
on
the
intelligence-sharing
when
it
come
to
keep
we
safe
domestically
and
even
globally
well
I
think
we
be
actually
do
quite
well
I
say
we
the
United
States
and
some
of
we
ally
the
Belgians
be
certainly
a
example
at
the
opposite
end
I
live
in
Brussels
for
year
it
be
really
a
incoherent
domestic
law
enforcement
situation
but
that
do
not
apply
in
the
United
States
I
think
generally
speak
the
domestic
intelligence-sharing
of
local
police
agency
state
police
force
and
the
federal
law
enforcement
extremely
good
it
be
not
that
way
20
year
ago
it
be
today
let
talk
about
that
specifically
especially
when
it
come
to
that
arrest
make
out
of
Rochester
there
this
be
the
person
the
FBI
say
have
plan
want
to
essentially
prove
himself
to
isis
loyalist
say
you
know
what
I
can
do
it
even
go
so
far
as
go
with
a
FBI
informant
into
a
walmart
locally
and
buy
the
mask
the
machete
and
everything
to
have
this
attack
plan
out
but
be
stop
so
that
be
get
to
be
in
some
sense
if
I
live
in
Rochester
yes
that
would
make
I
afraid
but
I
would
also
be
comfort
to
know
that
the
intelligence
be
there
to
stop
he
well
you
know
I
think
this
guy
--
obviously
the
mental
health
case
this
will
be
a
very
difficult
case
to
prosecute
he
do
not
even
have
the
money
to
buy
a
machete
but
that
do
not
make
it
any
less
dangerous
I
mean
obviously
he
could
have
carry
out
a
attack
and
seriously
injured
people
but
again
you
know
what
we
need
to
do
be
protect
against
the
kind
of
attack
that
just
occur
in
Paris
we
get
organize
team
automatic
weapon
suicide
vest
that
be
the
big
threat
we
have
get
a
lot
of
mental
health
issue
that
local
law
enforcement
know
who
they
be
they
be
go
to
have
to
monitor
they
but
boy
that
be
very
difficult
to
protect
against
that
sort
of
thing
scary
to
some
extent
be
know
what
happen
in
San
Bernardino
and
you
know
the
intelligence
that
be
not
there
for
that
general
Barry
McCaffrey
thank
you
for
be
with
we
happy
new
year
to

Jason

Geoffrey
it
be
Jason
it
could

Brenda
we
be
stay
on
top
of
that
break
news
from
Tel
Aviv
where
police
say
a
gunman
open
fire
at
a
bar
kill
at
least
two
people
before
flee
the
scene
on
the
right
you
see
the
aftermath
on
the
left
video
of
that
very
moment
of
the
shooting
several
people
be
also
injure
there
include
two
who
be
now
in
critical
condition
and
there
be
a
massive
manhunt
under
way
police
say
the
motive
be
still
unclear
with
I
now
be
MSNBC
CAL
parry
senior
editor
for
video
digital
content
as
we
delve
into
this
no
idea
if
this
be
criminal-related
terrorist-related
we
have
to
delve
into
the
culture
of
violence
there
especially
when
it
come
to
organize
crime
in
Tel
Aviv
and
the
mafia
and
it
be
something
people
be
not
familiar
with
we
hear
we
guest
earlier
say
it
do
not
make
global
headline
one
of
the
interesting
question
about
this
gunman
be
how
do
he
get
away
how
do
he
get
away
so
fast
at
its
height
the
biggest
mafia
family
in
Israel
in
2004
control
more
than
30
company
more
than
40
apartment
and
more
than
50
vehicle
so
that
give
you
a
idea
of
the
reach
and
the
power
that
some
of
these
underground
family
have
in
Tel
Aviv
in
place
like
Natanya
in
the
north
of
Israel
so
it
be
sort
of
a
established
thing
in
Israel
and
as
we
watch
this
story
unfold
there
be
certain
question
that
need
to
be
ask
--
why
do
the
gunman
not
turn
he
gun
on
more
people
outside
this
cafe
why
do
he
leave
so
quickly
all
of
those
question
be
the
very
question
israeli
official
and
police
be
go
to
be
ask
and
there
also
have
not
be
a
broader
warning
to
citizen
in
Tel
Aviv
--
look
out
for
this
person
and
we
do
have
some
video
evidence
of
who
this
person
be
all
of
which
--
and
again
way
too
early
to
tell
we
be
go
to
wait
for
israeli
official
to
declare
whether
or
not
this
be
a
terror
attack
or
a
criminally
related
attack
but
early
indication
be
perhaps
this
be
criminally
relate
when
you
look
at
all
of
these
question
and
unknown
and
just
base
on
this
video
it
seem
like
the
gun
be
pointed
shot
fire
as
you
see
the
customer
of
the
restaurant
run
for
cover
fear
for
they
life
a
few
shot
fire
there
but
do
not
seem
to
be
you
know
point
the
gun
to
the
left
or
right
of
he
to
kind
of
spray
whoever
be
out
there
absolutely
and
this
be
not
indiscriminate
gunfire
I
know
it
look
like
it
be
indiscriminate
gunfire
but
one
of
the
key
to
this
and
one
of
the
key
to
the
investigation
be
go
to
be
who
be
target
so
police
investigator
right
now
be
in
those
hospital
they
be
talk
to
the
people
who
be
wound
to
try
to
find
out
be
this
a
mafia-type
hit
or
be
this
a
terrorist
attack
these
be
the
question
they
be
go
to
be
try
to
work
out
the
other
interesting
thing
in
that
video
and
we
be
circle
there
that
gun
--
that
be
not
a
m-16
rifle
that
look
to
be
a
uzi-type
gun
some
machine
gun
that
might
also
be
perhaps
a
indication
that
this
be
criminally
related
this
as
police
in
Tel
Aviv
be
search
for
the
gunman
who
get
away
we
do
not
know
if
he
have
any
help
this
person
run
off
on
they
own
or
where
to
but
also
interesting
to
note
how
this
will
end
we
speak
with
a
journalist
with
the
Associated
Press
earlier
who
say
at
this
point
there
in
Tel
Aviv
people
be
still
out
and
about
know
that
this
happen
know
this
take
place
but
I
can
understand
still
very
tense
know
that
this
have
not
end
they
do
not
know
how
it
be
go
to
end
peacefully
or
violent
and
there
be
some
very
uniquely
israeli
thing
that
we
be
go
to
see
in
the
come
hour
this
for
one
thing
be
a
Friday
afternoon
the
timing
of
that
this
would
have
be
a
very
crowded
street
this
be
Dizengoff
street
in
Tel
Aviv
so
it
would
have
be
very
crowd
these
bar
would
have
be
full
of
people
enjoy
they
Friday
afternoon
this
be
also
a
country
where
if
you
be
18
year
old
you
have
to
serve
in
the
army
so
you
be
carry
a
m-16
rifle
around
with
you
at
all
time
that
be
partly
why
it
seem
that
this
gunman
fleed
so
quickly
and
this
will
help
in
this
search
in
this
cordon
that
be
under
way
right
now
in
Tel
Aviv
hundred
of
officer
be
shut
down
various
part
of
the
city
they
be
go
house
to
house
apartment
to
apartment
look
for
this
gunman
and
again
local
media
--
and
this
be
a
point
you
have
be
make
all
morning
and
I
think
it
be
worth
repeat
--
local
media
be
go
to
refrain
from
show
some
of
the
live
picture
of
the
search
to
try
to
not
tip
off
this
gunman
all
right
stick
with
I
cal
as
I
bring
in
Mickey
Rosenfeld
Foreign
Press
spokesman
for
the
Israel
police
I
know
you
be
speak
with
we
earlier
and
at
that
point
you
be
very
very
careful
in
say
that
we
really
need
to
figure
out
first
as
far
as
the
authority
go
whether
this
be
a
terrorist
or
criminal
attack
have
anything
change
since
we
last
speak
with
you
have
you
hear
anything
more
especially
with
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
speak
at
one
point
say
that
he
believe
that
it
be
a
terrorist
attack
as
far
as
the
Israeli
National
Police
be
concerned
and
other
security
organization
we
be
still
examine
at
this
moment
in
time
almost
three
hour
after
the
attack
we
be
now
examine
cctv
footage
and
not
just
that
specific
video
which
I
be
sure
you
viewer
have
see
but
other
angle
and
other
cctv
footage
that
we
have
already
get
a
hold
of
as
part
of
the
investigation
so
we
be
look
at
a
number
of
different
angle
we
be
obviously
try
to
break
down
and
identify
the
individual
we
still
have
not
come
to
clear
conclusion
at
this
moment
in
time
whether
it
be
in
fact
a
terrorist
attack
or
not
and
possibly
a
criminal-related
incident
it
be
go
to
take
time
but
the
most
important
aspect
at
the
moment
be
make
sure
that
the
area
in
Tel
Aviv
on
one
hand
continue
and
the
different
area
be
still
open
and
I
be
refer
to
more
than
the
different
area
that
be
still
fully
functional
but
at
the
time
where
the
israeli
police
be
carry
out
search
both
in
apartment
building
as
well
as
other
construction
site
make
sure
that
those
area
specifically
be
shut
down
important
to
emphasize
that
there
be
no
specific
intelligence
whatsoever
of
a
terrorist
attack
that
be
go
to
take
place
in
Tel
Aviv
or
any
other
major
city
across
the
country
although
we
do
have
over
the
last
24
hour
many
police
officer
in
the
street
for
the
new
year
eve
celebration
which
take
place
so
we
operational
unit
be
still
continue
in
the
different
area
those
specific
area
within
the
radius
of
about
two
mile
of
where
the
incident
take
place
but
unfortunately
what
we
have
conclude
until
now
be
that
two
Israelis
be
kill
we
definitely
know
there
be
a
automatic
weapon
that
be
use
we
know
about
15
just
over
15
shot
be
fire
sporadically
luckily
no
one
else
be
kill
and
there
be
still
a
large
hunt
go
on
at
this
moment
in
time
to
try
and
find
that
suspect
Micky
with
that
large
hunt
talk
to
I
about
how
the
public
be
affect
be
resident
be
tell
to
stay
in
they
home
be
there
lockdown
situation
there
and
what
be
the
public
be
tell
well
within
the
two-mile
area
we
be
ask
member
of
the
public
to
stay
at
they
home
at
this
moment
in
time
one
of
the
issue
be
that
it
be
already
now
sun
go
down
it
be
already
dark
the
sabbath
have
come
in
so
a
lot
of
people
be
make
they
way
to
synagogue
so
we
have
heighten
security
in
term
of
the
Israeli
National
Police
you
will
find
security
at
all
of
the
synagogue
in
the
Tel
Aviv
area
we
do
not
want
a
second
incident
or
second
shooting
unfold
in
any
way
whatsoever
so
the
accessionment
be
be
that
gunman
be
try
to
keep
a
low
profile
stay
where
he
be
at
this
moment
in
hiding
and
this
be
the
exact
amount
of
time
that
we
have
to
try
and
get
to
he
as
quick
as
possible
all
right
with
that
in
mind
as
you
be
tell
we
about
the
heighten
security
I
can
imagine
that
be
the
case
in
other
place
as
well
we
be
actually
just
get
in
information
on
the
number
of
injure
that
be
conflict
can
you
confirm
how
many
people
have
be
injure
and
to
what
degree
as
far
as
I
know
until
now
from
the
scene
itself
there
be
ten
people
injured
altogether
with
a
breakdown
unfortunately
of
two
people
that
be
pronounced
dead
four
people
that
be
take
seriously
to
hospital
and
apart
from
that
another
four
people
that
be
injure
moderately
okay
as
a
result
of
gunfire
at
the
scene
itself
so
those
be
the
update
as
far
as
I
know
until
now
from
the
hospital
other
people
be
take
to
hospital
with
shock
and
be
treat
but
the
physical
injury
as
I
understand
until
now
be
ten
people
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
investigation
go
on
now
as
far
as
know
if
this
gunman
act
by
themselves
or
have
the
help
of
other
especially
in
get
away
so
quickly
well
that
be
something
we
be
look
into
he
could
have
be
in
the
close
area
for
the
few
minute
before
at
tack
he
might
have
be
in
a
apartment
wait
or
in
a
nearby
store
he
might
be
in
some
apartment
building
now
try
to
hide
and
wait
until
the
police
search
that
area
and
move
on
but
most
of
the
area
within
that
two-mile
radius
be
very
very
intensive
as
far
as
the
police
unit
we
have
special
patrol
unit
undercover
unit
border
police
counterterrorism
unit
on
the
scene
at
the
moment
search
literally
every
step
every
door
so
it
be
a
question
of
time
until
we
get
to
that
suspect
in
previous
attack
and
in
previous
incident
that
have
take
place
it
be
a
question
of
time
put
together
intelligence
and
lead
if
it
be
a
criminal-related
incident
we
will
find
that
suspect
if
it
be
a
terrorist-related
suspect
then
we
might
have
to
use
odd
security
connection
lead
into
the
different
part
of
the
country
all
the
way
possibly
into
the
West
Bank
it
be
all
a
question
of
time
and
we
main
focus
be
to
get
to
that
individual
as
quick
as
possible
sure
and
I
hope
you
make
that
progress
especially
give
that
it
be
nightfall
there
in
Tel
Aviv
Micky
Rosenfeld
spokesperson
for
the
israeli
police
thanks
for
the
time
and
for
the
update
as
we
now
know
there
be
two
people
dead
four
hurt
seriously
four
other
who
be
hurt
in
this
shooting
at
a
bar
a
restaurant
in
Tel
Aviv
where
the
gunman
have
flee
the
scene
and
there
be
a
massive
manhunt
under
way
in
Tel
Aviv
we
will
take
a
quick
break
and
come
back
after
where
be
you
well
the
squirrel
be
back
in
the
attic
mom
you
dad
will
not
call
a
exterminator
can
I
call
you
back
mom
he
say
it
be
personal
this
time
if
you
be
a
mom
you
call
at
the
worst
time
it
be
what
you
do
if
you
want
to
save
fifteen
percent
or
more
on
car
insurance
you
switch
to
GEICO
it
be
what
you
do
where
be
you
it
be
very
loud
there
be
you
take
a
zumba
class
more
perspective
now
on
that
deadly
shooting
in
Tel
Aviv
where
a
gunman
open
fire
in
a
bar
law
enforcement
a
lis
Jim
Cavanaugh
retire
special
agent
in
charge
join
I
now
Jim
as
we
be
hear
these
detail
especially
with
you
perspective
you
have
work
with
Tel
Aviv
police
before
--
israeli
police
I
should
say
--
what
be
you
takeaway
in
what
be
happen
there
well
they
be
do
a
good
job
they
be
very
efficient
the
Israeli
national
police
yes
Frances
I
have
be
in
Tel
Aviv
work
with
they
they
have
share
lot
of
training
on
bomb
squad
across
the
year
and
I
think
what
they
get
here
be
they
get
this
gunman
who
show
up
he
be
get
a
small
automatic
rifle
it
look
like
a
pistol
we
would
actually
call
it
because
of
the
pistol
grip
that
be
concealable
it
may
be
a
draco
a
mini
draco
it
could
be
a
uzi
it
be
a
small
weapon
but
I
think
the
important
part
be
when
you
look
at
that
video
--
and
I
have
look
at
it
many
time
already
--
he
begin
shooting
before
you
even
see
he
so
he
begin
shoot
behind
the
curtain
and
the
patron
be
react
to
the
gunfire
and
he
sweep
across
the
patron
and
as
they
run
into
the
bar
he
lose
they
target
they
run
away
from
he
and
then
he
sweep
across
the
sidewalk
try
to
shoot
everybody
over
there
so
you
know
and
I
be
familiar
with
the
organize
crime
in
Tel
Aviv
we
have
share
information
on
the
bombing
they
have
they
do
have
organize
crime
they
do
have
hit
murder
just
like
we
do
in
America
so
certainly
it
could
be
that
but
it
do
not
look
like
a
hit
on
a
particular
person
I
mean
you
could
have
gang
violence
you
know
want
to
hit
every
patron
at
a
bar
or
something
but
he
really
look
like
he
be
try
to
just
shoot
at
the
crowd
if
you
slow
that
down
you
will
see
before
you
even
see
the
gunman
the
people
react
to
the
gunfire
and
they
be
duck
and
then
he
first
shot
be
right
toward
the
curtain
he
be
shoot
at
the
crowd
as
they
run
inside
he
sweep
in
a
45
across
the
sidewalk
probably
shoot
at
other
escape
patron
so
they
have
get
to
determine
you
know
the
target
the
motive
and
where
be
the
shooter
where
be
the
shooter
and
how
it
will
end
whether
he
be
take
into
custody
peacefully
if
there
be
a
standoff
more
violence
that
so
law
enforcement
have
to
be
very
careful
in
do
this
especially
give
this
area
a
very
busy
area
a
commercial
area
although
it
be
nightfall
there
now
but
something
certainly
they
be
consider
Jim
right
Frances
you
know
we
have
see
lately
all
the
attack
in
Israel
have
be
sort
of
knife
attack
sharp-edged
object
car
drive
into
crowd
as
oppose
to
ten
year
ago
when
we
see
the
spate
of
suicide
bombing
at
the
restaurant
and
in
the
bus
and
on
the
street
but
you
could
have
a
terrorist
attack
it
could
be
I
mean
it
could
be
a
terrorist
attack
a
person
with
a
rifle
a
pistol
like
that
who
do
not
want
to
be
catch
not
all
terrorist
attacker
be
suicide
attacker
all
right
Jim
Cavanaugh
as
always
good
to
have
you
with
I
also
with
I
be
MSNBC
contributor
Steve
Clemons
who
join
I
now
and
Steve
as
we
be
await
more
information
try
to
find
out
the
motive
here
whether
it
be
terrorist-related
criminal
or
even
organize
crime
you
takeaway
and
to
you
what
be
the
marking
there
give
the
video
that
we
have
be
show
over
the
very
moment
that
this
shooting
happen
well
look
we
be
all
grasp
at
very
little
right
now
in
look
at
this
a
lot
of
odd
moment
very
clearly
the
gunman
be
someone
who
want
to
get
away
with
he
life
a
lot
of
the
terrorism
we
see
be
people
that
be
very
commit
to
create
such
a
footprint
for
they
terrorism
that
they
be
willing
to
kind
of
go
all
in
with
they
own
life
this
be
a
person
who
escape
go
away
make
a
hit
and
want
to
go
on
with
the
next
day
so
that
be
one
of
the
other
element
of
this
I
be
impress
by
Micky
Feldman
steadiness
in
be
sure
to
differentiate
between
the
possibility
that
this
be
either
a
criminal
act
or
terrorism
and
I
think
that
be
important
to
keep
in
mind
for
all
of
we
that
we
just
do
not
know
a
lot
right
now
but
as
you
point
out
earlier
the
mayor
of
Tel
Aviv
jump
in
very
quickly
to
call
this
terrorism
without
a
lot
of
fact
and
when
you
have
the
ap
bureau
chief
he
say
well
I
would
love
to
see
the
information
he
have
so
we
need
to
be
careful
of
jump
to
conclusion
too
quickly
there
have
be
a
lot
of
twitter
traffic
on
this
that
there
have
not
be
a
claim
as
of
yet
by
any
palestinian
terrorist
group
so
there
be
a
lot
of
thread
that
we
need
to
pursue
all
right
we
appreciate
you
time
and
you
perspective
Steve
Clemons
thank

be
the
main
street
of
Tel
Aviv
there
be
CCTV
camera
all
over
in
Israel
not

but
here

should
see
more

come
out
from
different
angle
that
can
give
we
a
clearer
picture
of
what
happen
this
video
we
be
see
appear
to
be
from
the
cafe
the
pub
where
this
attack
take
place
but
police
very
certain
they
be
look
at
CCTV
footage
different
angle

to
figure
out
exactly
who
this
be

behind

different
unit
be
continue
to
search
the
different
area

who
be

just
over
two
hour
ago
at
the
same
time
what
be
develop
be
we
be
look
both
into
the
cctv
footage
we
have
now
get
hold
of
which
be
part
of
what
we
can
see
exactly
what
take
place
at
the
scene
itself
both
from
inside
the
pub
which
be
relatively
pack
this
afternoon
and
to
find
from
which
angle
and
which
near
road
next
door
the
suppspect
come
in
from
the
main
emphasis
be
to
determine
if
we
be
talk
about
a
terrorist
attack
or
a
criminal-related
incident
it
be
obviously
very
significant
and
very
important
both
in
term
of
the
security
in
the
area
both
in
term
of
the
safety
of
the
public
on
a
Friday
afternoon
just
before
the
SA
bath
and
heighten
security
be
continue
at
the
moment
in

area
you
be
convince
there
be
one
gunman
when
we
see
the
video
we
see
one
gunman
be
you
search
for
more
than
one
at
this
point
in
time
we
be
search
for
base
on
the
cctv
footage
we
have
one
suspect
that
open
fire
with
a
automatic
weapon
that
we
know
for
sure
we
different
unit
counterterrorist
unit
special
patrol
unit
be

no
clear
intelligence
of
any
attack
that
be
go
to
take
place
across
any
major
city
in
Jerusalem
or
Tel
Aviv
therefore
we
main
emphasis
be
try
to
find
out
the
exact
background
whether
we
be
talk
about
criminal
related
or
terrorist
related
that
will
change
the
direction
and
the
seriousness
of
the
incident
we

appear
as
though
the

toward
the
busy
street
can
you
give
we
a
idea
of
those

paint
the
picture
for
we
of

Ben

start
the
new
year
with
a
shakeup
atop
he
campaign
Carson
campaign
manager
deputy
manager
and
communication
director
have
all
resign
this
come
as
Carson
t
continue
to
struggle
in
the
poll
the
latest
CNN
poll
show
he
a
distant
third
place
CNN
Sara
Murray
join
we
now
with
the
very
latest
on
this
so
what
be
the
reaction
from
the
Carson
campaign
how
be
they
spin
this
this
have
be
a
interesting
shakeup
at
first
Ben
Carson
do
interview
say
I
be
prepare
for
a
campaign
shakeup
then
he
sort
of
walk
it
back
say
he
be
happy
with
he
senior
team
ultimately
a
number
of
staffer
have
end
up
leave
anyway
they
leave
they
put
out
a
statement
and
they
say
they
respect
the
candidate
and
we
have
enjoy
help
he
go
from
the
back
in
the
field
to
the
top-tier
status
they
say
they
be
proud
of
he
effort
and
wish
he
the
best
but
ultimately
they
feel
they
could
not
stay
on
when
you
look
at
how
the
Carson
campaign
be
respond
to
this
Ben
Carson
put
out
a
statement
essentially
say
we
need
this
sort
of
transition
to
jump
start
he
say
it
be
necessary
to
invigorate
my
campaign
with
a
strategy
that
more
aggressively
share
my
vision
so
it
do
not
seem
like
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
love
loss
on
either
side
in
term
of
this
departure
look
a
lot
of
this
friction
we
see
in
the
campaign
have
to
deal
with
these
outside
operative
deal
with
Armstrong
Williams
who
be
Ben
Carson
long-time
business
manager
he
be
on
CNN
yesterday
and
he
acknowledge
that
the
Carson
campaign
have
sort
of
be
work
on
they
candidate
and
sometimes
you
know
after
these
terrorist
attack
people
have
get
the
sense
Ben
Carson
be
not
as
tough
as
they
want
they
candidate
to
be
take
a
listen
to
what
he
say
Carson
be
not
the
one
that
stand
like
Trump
or
Cruz
and
say
all
these
thing
and
people
think
because
you
speak
loud
and
say
fiery
thing
you
be
a
leader
and
you
be
in
control
he
be
soft-spoken
sometimes
people
confuse
soft-spokenness
with
not
be
strong
enough
Carson
have
learn
that
soft-spokenness
be
not
enough
he
will
be
more
authoritarian
in
the
way
that
he
speak
you
see
the
campaign
be
acknowledge
there
be
weakness
both
with
the
candidate
and
the
operation
I
think
the
challenge
after
a
shakeup
like
this
be
what
happen
next
can
you
regroup
and
can
you
deliver
a
solid
ground
game
in
Iowa
can
you
prevent
additional
unforced
error
and
buckle
down
in
the
final
week
of
the
caucus
and
get
you
poll
number
up
we
will
have
to
see
if
the
Carson
campaign
can
pull
that
off
thank
you
very
much
we
will
talk
about
this
more
now
the
2016
race
with
CNN
senior
political
analyst
Ron
Brownstein
along
with
CNN
political
commentator
Peter
happy
new
year
gentleman
happy
new
year
let
talk
about
this
Carson
shakeup
Ron
be
this
as
simple
as
Carson
put
it
to
invigorate
the
word
he
use
or
be
it
a
sign
of
something
else
I
think
it
be
a
sign
of
the
situation
that
he
be
in
the
presidential
campaign
and
primary
have
become
a
national
audition
where
everyone
see
the
candidate
at
big
moment
when
Carson
have
the
spotlight
he
simply
do
not
seem
prepared
for
the
presidency
many
Republicans
admire
he
life
story
but
he
do
not
project
the
authority
or
understanding
of
some
of
these
issue
that
be
require
in
a
president
I
think
as
a
result
he
moment
have
probably
pass
in
term
of
be
a
major
factor
in
this
race
he
still
have
a
audience
a
much
smaller
audience
and
I
think
it
will
be
hard
for
he
to
restore
any
of
the
support
he
have
earlier
how
do
you
dissect
those
who
leave
the
campaign
with
complimentary
word
on
the
exit
the
statement
be
very
gentil
look
I
think
a
lot
of
people
hold
Ben
Carson
in
high
esteem
as
Ron
say
this
be
a
campaign
which
have
basically
be
in
freefall
back
in
the
fall
Ben
Carson
be
actually
lead
the
race
at
a
certain
point
nationally
now
he
be
way
down
in
the
pack
nationally
sx
specially
in
Iowa
which
be
a
key
state
for
he
give
the
influence
of
the
evangelical
christian
it
be
not
surprising
you
tend
to
see
staff
shakeup
and
all
kind
of
warfare
in
campaign
that
be
struggle
no
campaign
in
the
second
half
of
2015
see
a
more
dramatic
rise
and
dramatic
fall
than
Ben
Carson
so
Senator
Ted
Cruz
now
be
make
some
bold
prediction
in
this
new
year
too
to
campaign
volunteer
during
a
conference
call
this
be
what
he
tell
they
about
2016
he
tell
they
quote
this
be
a
very
good
possibility
that
the
republican
primary
will
be
decide
by
the
end
of
March
first
thing
tomorrow
we
have
get
a
90-day
sprint
to
get
the
job
do
and
then
add
he
expect
to
be
the
nominee
Peter
you
reaction
to
the
statement
the
timetable
that
Cruz
campaign
be
forecast
there
I
think
the
Cruz
campaign
have
have
a
clear
strategy
have
you
to
give
they
credit
for
that
it
be
to
win
Iowa
it
be
to
do
very
well
in
South
Carolina
where
evangelical
be
strong
and
to
clean
up
in
what
be
call
the
primary
a
lot
of
state
in
the
deep
south
where
Cruz
give
he
be
emerge
as
the
evangelical
candidate
in
many
way
be
well
position
I
think
the
danger
for
he
be
that
the
race
be
not
over
and
that
the
establishment
wing
of
the
party
consolidate
around
someone
probably
Rubio
and
the
state
that
come
after
the
big
southern
state
be
more
in
the
Midwest
and
east
and
state
where
someone
like
Rubio
might
begin
to
have
a
better
chance
you
might
see
the
establishment
really
rally
around
a
alternative
to
Cruz
because
most
Washington
Republicans
hate
Cruz
and
most
think
he
will
lose
big
and
hurt
they
in
Congress
if
they
get
the
chance
they
will
rally
around
someone
else
Ron
Senator
Cruz
GOP
rival
Donald
Trump
be
on
Fox
last
night
just
before
midnight
give
a
prediction
of
he
own
in
this
election
year
let
listen
well
I
hope
you
be
go
to
be
call
the
White
House
and
I
promise
you
will
get
through
you
will
always
be
invite
and
we
be
go
to
do
something
really
special
we
be
go
to
make
a
lot
of
amends
for
the
mistake
that
have
be
make
over
the
year
so
I
hope
you
be
go
to
be
call
the
White
House
so
Ron
--
I
love
the
expression
right
away
no
he
be
nothing
if
not
confident
as
you
know
you
should
be
in
the
primary
look
the
Ted
Cruz
assumption
be
that
the
race
will
quickly
reduce
to
two
candidate
will
he
consolidate
the
right
there
will
be
one
more
center
right
and
he
will
win
historically
the
center
right
opponent
have
win
in
the
first
place
more
importantly
Cruz
strategy
kind
of
assume
the
second
part
disappear
which
be
that
Donald
Trump
be
not
there
and
Donald
Trump
be
I
think
a
big
--
trump
and
Cruz
be
a
challenge
for
each
other
if
the
center
produce
a
candidate
because
they
do
overlap
in
they
support
particularly
among
blue-collar
evangelical
christian
the
Cruz
assumption
be
that
trump
kind
of
go
away
and
he
can
consolidate
the
right
against
someone
in
the
center

welcome
back
this
just
into
CNN
new
document
reveal
Freddie
Gray
who
suffer
a
spinal
injury
and
later
die
while
in
Baltimore
police
custody
may
have
have
a
previous
back
injury
accord
to
defense
attorney
for
one
of
the
officer
charge
Cesar
Goodson
see
here
on
the
right
and
have
already
plead
not
guilty
last
month
a
judge
declare
a
mistrial
for
police
officer
William
Porter
after
juror
be
unable
to
reach
a
unanimous
decision
on
he
case
let
go
straight
to
CNN
Miguel
Marquez
one
have
to
wonder
if
this
will
change
the
argument
for
prosecutor
who
be
try
to
establish
that
something
awry
happen
that
lead
to
a
fatal
injury
for
Freddie
Gray
the
document
we
be
talk
about
be
defense
attorney
for
Cesar
Gray
they
want
everything
in
he
medical
past
and
also
he
incarceration
record
a
separate
document
follow
by
the
defense
say
there
be
a
anonymous
tip
they
have
never
be
able
to
confirm
that
Gray
try
to
harm
himself
while
in
central
booking
in
Baltimore
this
particular
document
about
the
medical
record
indicate
that
on
March
31st
the
timing
be
curious
to
I
on
March
31st
they
say
Gray
be
in
the
western
district
police
station
that
be
where
he
eventually
wind
up
not
breathing
but
this
be
week
before
he
be
arrest
by
police
in
that
incident
and
that
he
be
get
police
information
about
a
robbery
so
one
it
tell
we
that
Freddie
Gray
work
with
police
or
at
least
on
that
occasion
be
and
secondly
they
say
he
complain
of
a
bad
back
not
that
he
have
a
previous
back
injury
or
there
be
a
surgery
or
anything
else
but
that
he
have
a
bad
back
and
he
back
be
in
pain
that
day
what
be
curious
be
that
document
be
file
on
May
1st
so
the
conversation
happen
March
31st
accord
to
the
officer
prior
to
Gray
injury
while
in
police
custody
and
then
it
be
file
on
May
1st
after
those
injury
have
occur
that
will
be
look
at
as
well
the
prosecution
in
all
of
this
have
file
document
say
the
defense
should
have
none
of
this
because
none
of
it
be
relevant
to
what
happen
to
Gray
in
the
back
of
that
police
van
they
say
whatever
happen
to
he
in
the
back
of
that
police
van
be
so
traumatic
it
snap
he
spine
essentially
hurt
he
very
badly
and
then
lead
to
he
death
some
day
later

first
Fredericka

I
I

prayer
go

it

a
very
sad

all
re-evaluate
how

Carson
do
that
general
Bob
Dee
he
campaign
chairman
which
lead
to
a
couple
of
people
resign

we
be
move
forward
some
might
interpret

slip
in

poll
how
do
the

better
job
always
of
get
Carson
message
out
that
be
what
we
plan
to
do
so
raise
money
but
lose
traction
I
would
say
that
poll
go
up
and
down
s
especially
national
poll
February
1st
be
what
we
be
focus
on
in
caucus
night

have
have
over
people
have
attend
we
event
in
Iowa
we
feel
good
about
we
opportunity
to
do
very
well
when
we
get
to
the
caucus
on
February
1st
Armstrong
William
Carson
business
manager
as
you
know
be
on
CNN
yesterday
characterize
this
announcement
as
a
burden
be
lift
off
Carson
what
do
you
suppose
he
mean
by
that
I
do
not
know
he
be
a
guest
here
often
ask
he
next
time
but
when
that
message
be
send
by
someone
who
be
a
close
associate
close
aide
of
Carson
and
say
that
you
know
a
burden
have
be
lift
I
mean
how
do
the
campaign
respond
to
that
or
what
burden
might
he
be
speak
of
I
do
not
know
what
burden
Armstrong
may
have
be
speak
of
I
do
know
we
be
still
operate
today
as
we
do
yesterday
and
the
day
before
and
will
do
tomorrow
very
focus
on
work
with
we
team
we
staff
we
volunteer
we
donor
to
get
Carson
message
out
as
the
communication
director
what
be
the
message
send
within
the
campaign
that
need
to
be
the
primary
focus
in
this
new
year
as
it
pertain
to
resuscitate
Carson
viability
we
want
to
get
we
message
in
front
of
as
many
voter
as
possible
especially
those
voter
who
agree
with
Carson
message
of
want
to
heal
what
be
wrong
with
we
country
and
revive
the
american
spirit
once
again
we
will
focus
on
that
through
social
media
volunteer
door
knock
as
we
move
forward
heal
the
country
I
know
that
be
the
big
moniker
but
specifically
can
voter
expect
to
hear
something
more
concrete
from
Carson
the
campaign
from
you
the
communication
director
in
this
new
year
I
think
that
--
I
think
that
you
will
I
think
Carson
be
pretty
specific
about
what
he
want
to
do
in
term
of
tax
in
term
of
deal
with
Isis
in
term
of
deal
with
the
race
problem
that
this
country
face
and
I
think
that
you
will
continue
to
hear
those
kind
of
plan
and
program
as
we
move
forward
and
just
with
day
away
from
say
the
Iowa
caucus
be
there
a
direct
message
a
particular
strategy
that
you
as
the
new
communication
director
want
to
reveal
to
try
to
capture
some
of
the
support
that
may
have
be
lose
in
recent
week
we
just
want
to
keep
get
Carson
in
front
of
as
many
people
as
possible
I
apologize
as
new
campaign
manager
what
do
you
think
--
you
give
I
another
new
title
there
you
be
do
it
all
right
as
the
campaign
manager
what
in
particular
do
you
think
need
to
be
do
to
better
support
better
you
know
recapture
some
of
the
support
that
Carson
may
have
lose
particularly
after
he
visit
to
the
refugee
camp
Jordan
it
seem
as
though
that
be
when
some
of
he
support
take
a
dip
in
the
poll
I
think
we
need
to
stay
very
focus
at
we
task
at
hand
it
be
not
simple
--
I
mean
be
not
hard
to
describe
but
it
be
one
we
need
to
execute
better
on
and
that
be
get
we
message
out
to
the
voter

right

consider
themselves
and
I
certainly
consider
they
artist
these
be
the
people
under
different
circumstance
would
be
painter
and
poet
but
because
of
the
time
we
live
in
this
new
medium
have
appear
in
which
one
express
themselves
to
fellow
species
and
that
be
a
means
of
computing
how

you
can
catch

you

if
I
dance
Sydney

Clinton
forwards
many
of

he
say

my

this
be
awful
White

have
just
complicate
not
only
the
NGO
issue
by
the
IMF
negotiation
a
forward
to
CLINTON
wow
Clinton
offer
of
the
assessment
totally
whacko
one
of
the
few
instance
of

displeasure
with

Cheryl

write
that
it
be
go
viral
you
always
have
the
photo
of
the
blackberry
we
have
issue
of
national
security
and
the
issue
of
Clinton
day-to-day
life
I
guess
there
be
a
seating
flow
chart
apparently
vital
to
the
operation
of
the
State
Department
it
be
design
to
get
the
formatting
right
a
lengthy

to
determine
which

should
ride

in

car
while

thanks
rich
let
we
know
if
you
find
anything
else
president
Obama
plan
to
get
right
to
work
on
gun
control
when
he
return
to
Washington
he
will
meet
with
Loretta
Lynch
Monday
to
discuss
what
executive
action
he
can
take
to
try
to
keep
gun
out
of
criminal
hand
what
be
the
idea
behind
this
meeting
with
the
attorney
general
I
think
what
be
behind
this
be
the
tightrope
we
have
be
watch
for
quite
some
time
the
president
have
he
legal
team
poring
over
exist
law
and
other
document
to
create
a
executive
action
that
can
with
stand
congressional
muster
we
have
watch
they
painstakingly
go
over
this
process
so
he
be
go
to
be
meet
with
she
to
make
sure
what
be
construct
be
not
only
lawful
but
also
enforceable
we
know
we
can
not
stop
every
act
of
violence
but
what
if
we
try
to
stop
even
one
what
if
Congress
do
something
know
protect
we
kid
from
gun
violence
a
few
month
ago
I
dpliectd
team
at
the
White
House
to
look
into
any
new
action
I
can
take
to
reduce
gun
violence
Monday
I
will
meet
with
we
southern
general
Loretta
Lynch
to
discuss
we
option
one
of
the
main
thing
you
will
be
watch
be
the
president
hope
to
stand
background
check
from
dealer
background
check
be
already
a
reality
for
the
vast
majority
of
gun
purchase
but
it
be
try
to
narrowly
scope
the
expansion
of
those
background
check
we
will
have
to
see
how
they
craft
the
law
and
how
enforceable
it
be
the
president
make
a
personal
appeal
to
the
american
people
in
the
address
tell
we
about
that
this
will
be
a
executive
action
part
of
it
will
be
try
to
couple
with
a
executive
action
and
make
a
sale
pitch
to
the
american
people
this
be
not
about
take
away
you
rights
this
be
as
much
about
create
a
environment
that
be
more
safe
for
you
than
it
have
be
before
listen
carefully
how
the
president
frame
that
the
gun
lobby
be
loud
and
well
organize
in
its
defense
of
effortlessly
available
gun
for
anyone
the
rest
of
we
will
have
to
be
just
as
passionate
and
well
organize
in
we
defense
we
kid
that
be
the
work
of
citizenship
to
stand
up
and
fight
for
the
change
we
see
I
hope
you
will
join
I
in
make
America
safer
for
all
of
we
child
the
change
we
seek
mean
not
just
the
change
you
might
see
in
you
family
and
the
change
you
might
shep
create
in
you
community
but
I
believe
they
be
try
to
nudge
the
american
people
to
talk
to
they
congressal
leader
how
much
controversy
surround
this
will
depend
on
how
narrowly
focus
the
executive
action
we
learn
about
be
we
will
be
watch
carefully
some
more
executive
action
to
come
thank
you
join
we
for
more
on
this
Daniel
Harper
when
we
look
at
this
in
a
political
context
and
the
president
take
executive
action
it
seem
like
hang
red
meat
for
republican
you
can
expect
every
republican
candidate
Bernie
Sanders
all
the
Republicans
to
weigh
in
on
president
Obama
executive
action
on
gun
they
will
have
to
take
a
stand
and
it
will
become
a
major
issue
people
want
to
know
be
the
politician
run
for
office
will
they
keep
these
executive
action
or
will
they
kick
it
back
to
Congress
and
have
Congress
make
these
decision
keep
in
mind
president
Obama
want
Congress
to
pass
law
they
do
not
pass
law
therefore
he
be
go
at
it
alone
it
be
be
he
in
term
of
immigration
and
the
EPA
and
other
issue
so
it
be
become
a
huge
issue
it
will
remain
a
major
issue
go
forward
who
do
this
favor
the
generic
Democrat
or
Republican
it
galvanize
Republicans
they
say
we
do
not
like
these
executive
action
it
galvanize
Democrats
I
think
republican
tend
to
think
it
phase
they
and
Democrats
think
it
phase
themselves
Obama
be
not
politically
naive
he
have
be
good
at
get
himself
re-elected
he
be
somewhat
popular
for
a
lame
duck
president
so
I
do
not
--
Democrats
make
the
case
that
people
view
gun
control
differently
than
they
do
10
year
ago
and
it
be
the
change
demographic
and
the
way
new
Americans
think
about
these
issue
rather
than
how
it
use
to
be
there
be
congressman
who
tell
you
the
on
the
thing
they
feerteer
than
fear
itself
be
the
NRA
do
you
think
the
president
will
not
care
about
the
political
implication
no
love
lose
between
he
and
the
Clintons
I
do
not
think
that
be
the
case
I
think
if
president
Obama
get
elect
and
the
next
president
can
sign
executive
order
negate
everything
then
president
Obama
presidency
look
smaller
he
need
a
Democrat
to
be
the
next
president
to
keep
in
place
a
lot
of
the
thing
he
set
forward
I
do
not
think
he
risk
at
all
on
something
so
controversial
both
side
be
make
calculation
in
this
political
fight
and
there
will
be
more
so
but
Hillary
Clinton
when
she
be
run
against
Barack
Obama
she
be
far
more
pro
gun
now
she
adopt
president
Obama
view
on
gun
control
that
suggest
a
shift
in
the
electorate
in
they
think
about
these
gun
and
she
think
it
be
helpful
to
they
obviously
come
up
be
the
primary
so
it
help
Hillary
in
a
primary
and
Republicans
in
they
own
primary
to
come
out
strongly
against
this
we
will
wait
as
new
year
day
we
will
see
what
the
reaction
be
from
some
of
the
2016

range
of
GOP
frontrunner
Donald

as
a
result
I
want
to

get

get

for
the

that
be
come
let
bring
in
the
chief
political
correspondent
for
the
review
happy
new
year
we
can
not
start
off
2016
without
talk
about
Donald
Trump
or
Ted
Cruz
or
somebody
run
for
office
a
lot
of
people
say
this
could
go
to
a
broker
convention
for
hip
to
be
the
nominee
a
lot
will
have
to
change
include
bring
down
Donald
Trump
Ted
Cruz
have
a
lot
of
grassroot
support
we
be
mention
Iowa
when
you
be
look
at
the
primary
come
up
and
the
comment
just
make
these
individual
get
it
Ted
Cruz
I
think
will
be
someone
who
be
really
anti-establishment
candidate
that
wave
of
the
antiestablishment
momentum
be
sweeping
across
the
country
but
with
hip
he
be
gain
momentum
he
will
be
gain
more
money
with
that
will
come
more
attack
against
he
as
well
but
the
grassroot
movement
be
clearly
behind
he
he
speak
to
that
and
warn
they
about
attack
come
he
way
let
hear
what
he
say
about
that
there
be
a
lot
of
folk
in
politic
who
be
not
constrain
by
what
they
view
be
a
quaint
notion
of
the
truth
they
believe
particularly
as
you
get
close
to
a
election
day
they
can
toss
out
any
lie
any
attack
and
the
attack
will
do
the
damage
before
anyone
discover
it
be
not
true
I
want
everyone
to
get
ready
because
that
be
come
warn
that
people
who
support
he
that
attack
be
come
he
way
that
be
lie
I
be
think
of
a
feud
between
he
and
Donald
Trump
Donald
Trump
say
he
be
not
evangelical
I
be
evangelical
someone
who
grow
up
in
New
York
and
have
be
around
Donald
trump
all
this
time
it
be
startling
rhetoric
he
be
talk
about
strap
on
the
armor
of
God
he
need
to
come
out
of
Iowa
with
a
win
there
be
no
other
way
for
hip
to
go
forward
and
he
be
in
good
shape
for
Super
Tuesday
the
prospects
be
similar
to
what
bowel
*
have
to
do
do
he
have
broad
enough
appeal
to
win
the
general
election
the
anti-establishment
wave
people
can
not
underestimate
that
even
in
Kentucky
you
have
the
republican
win
for
governor
in
that
state
people
be
tired
of
politician
not
stand
for
they
principle
that
be
very
important
I
do
think
that
Americans
be
recognize
that
he
be
someone
who
be
principled
he
be
a
great
debater
I
be
look
forward
to
the
next
debate
the
Fox
business
debate
I
will
be
there
do
you
think
Hillary
Clinton
should
be
nervous
about
Ted
Cruz
I
think
Hillary
Clinton
be
pray
for
Ted
Cruz
how
be
John
McCain
who
be
up
in
Arizona
the
say
year
he
would
purportedly
be
the
republican
nominee
run
with
somebody
who
he
have
be
so
vocally
critical
of
most
people
will
be
sit
on
they
hand
if
he
be
the
nominee
Janine
Julie
thank
you
for
spend
new
year
with
we
we
have
a
new
twist
on
the
so-called
Affluenza
teen
case
how
could
a
human
rights
violation
help
he
avoid
prison
time
in
the
United
States
we
will
look
at
amazing
and
most
frightening
video
of
2015
fireworkse
up
the
sky
in
Pyongyang
the
leader
Kim
JONG-UN
say
he
be
open
to
talk
with
anyone
who
be
open
to
reconciliation
and
peace
but
do
not
offer
up
talk
with
South
Korea
or
the
United
States
lawyer
for
the
take
stricken
with
affluenza
appear
to
be
try
to
stall
for
he
deportation
he
be
serve
probation
for
kill
four
people
be
find
in
Mexico
week
after
he
and
he
mother
disappear
now
he
lawyer
say
he
human
rights
be
violate
will
Carr
have
more
on
when
we
might
expect
to
see
couch
back
in
the
United
States
there
be
a
legal
battle
to
keep
couch
in
Mexico
but
when
he
come
back
to
the
United
States
the
maximum
he
can
spend
behind
bar
be
120
day
and
10
year
probation
and
that
be
only
if
the
case
be
switch
to
a
adult
court
it
be
possible
he
could
spend
just
as
much
time
in
the
immigration
detention
center
in
Mexico
where
it
all
get
sort
out
the
report
be
he
be
not
be
treat
any
differently
from
any
other
detainee
he
have
to
sleep
in
a
common
area
and
use
a
concrete
basin
to
wash
he
clothes
he
may
have
have
a
gun
with
he
in
Mexico
if
that
be
the
case
Mexico
have
stiff
gun
law
it
be
possible
he
could
serve
prison
time
in
Mexico
as
bad
as
some
of
the
american
prison
be
the
mexican
one
be
worse
he
mom
allegedly
help
he
escape
could
she
go
to
jail
as
well
she
be
in
Los
Angeles
await
a
extradition
hearing
to
go
back
to
Texas
she
attorney
release
a
statement
while
the
public
may
not
like
what
she
do
or
may
not
agree
with
what
she
do
she
do
not
violate
any
law
of
the
state
of
Texas
and
she
be
eager
to
have
she
day
in
court
authority
charge
she
with
a
felony
for
flee
with
she
son
and
if
convict
she
could
face
up
to
10
year
in
prison
we
will
see
what
the
judge
have
to
say
about
that
defense
will
Carr
with
we
live
from
Los
Angeles
heartland
as

begin
to
recede

people
Iowa
donor
people
attend
event
we
have
large
reservoir
of
volunteer
and
staff
to
go
we
look
forward
to
the
caucus
on
the
February
1st
as
we
look
at
real
clear
politics
average
of
the
top
six
Carson
have
take
a
significant
drop
in
the
poll
he
have
a
nice
bump
go
back
a
couple
month
ago
since
then
it
have
slide
significantly
how
do
you
turn
this
around
what
be
wrong
in
the
campaign
that
you
be
go
to
fix
we
just
need
to
keep
get
Carson
in
front
of
more
and
more
voter
as
people
listen
to
he
what
he
plan
be
they
come
to
he
we
job
be
to
get
he
in
front
of
more
people
more
often
more
quickly
in
a
fashion
that
will
target
the
people
who
will
agree
and
join
we
campaign
we
have
Erick
Erickson
on
earlier
in
the
show
he
tell
Abby
among
the
mistake
in
he
opinion
the
campaign
make
send
Carson
on
the
book
tour
say
thing
be
disorganize
hold
rally
in
state
that
do
not
have
primary
those
kind
of
thing
be
there
discipline
that
need
to
be
bring
to
this
campaign
can
you
turn
something
around
in
five
week
that
seem
so
disorganize
for
so
long
well
I
do
not
think
that
a
campaign
that
have
raise
more
money
than
anybody
else
have
over
five
million
follower
on
facebook
have
number
of
people
support
we
already
be
disorganize
I
think
we
need
to
get
bigger
and
better
and
faster
what
we
be
do
how
will
you
deal
with
Donald
Trump
when
he
start
attack
Carson
as
Carson
be
rise
in
the
poll
it
be
pretty
quick
dispatch
from
Trump
as
Carson
number
plummet
and
trump
rise
be
you
worry
about
that
how
be
you
deal
with
round
two
if
Carson
do
indeed
rise
again
we
will
work
on
what
Carson
message
be
one
of
hope
and
revive
America
and
appeal
to
the
country
we
will
stay
focus
on
Carson
and
he
message
this
be
a
little
bit
in
the
weed
for
we
viewer
one
of
the
reason
you
predecessor
Armstrong
woman
be
resign
because
he
feel
there
be
too
many
cook
in
the
kitchen
be
you
confident
that
you
have
Carson
ear
and
number
two
you
can
focus
this
politically
the
way
it
need
to
go
of
course
every
candidate
have
a
set
of
personal
advisors
we
welcome
what
Armstrong
do
for
the
campaign
we
will
work
well
together
where
be
Carson
on
foreign
policy
be
this
campaign
and
the
focus
on
Carson
increase
he
would
some
would
say
great
lack
in
the
foreign
policy
space
really
seem
to
show
have
not
so
great
moment
at
debate
and
other
place
attempt
to
fix
that
by
go
to
Jordan
it
do
not
really
seem
to
help
be
there
a
way
to
turn
this
around
to
come
up
with
a
concrete
for
rin
policy
message
for
someone
with
frankly
zero
foreign
policy
experience
I
dispute
the
premise
of
the
question
I
think
Carson
have
quite
a
bit
of
foreign
policy
experience
how
do
he
get
to
experience
he
travel
to
foreign
country
he
have
be
to
58
you
meet
with
foreign
leader
he
have
do
that
you
put
out
plan
and
program
he
have
the
most
specific
plan
of
any
candidate
how
to
deal
with
Isis
add
General
Bob
Deese
to
we
campaign
will
see
what
Carson
true
foreign
policy
experience
be
we
will
see
how
much
they
like
it

join
we
now
happy
new
year
to
you
happy
new
year
you
have
a
list
of
some
thing
that
happen
this
year
on
campus
I
want
to
get
you
thought
on
three
of
they
that
probably
stand
out
and
we
will
remember
a
long
time
University
of
American
Society
student
government
do
not
want
to
remember
a
or
do
a
moment
of
silence
they
say
it
would
violate
we
safe
space
you
thought
exactly
well
the
problem
be
that
so
many
college
student
these
day
be
so
morbidly
terrify
of
offend
they
fellow
student
or
perhaps
incite
racist
hatred
that
they
be
totally
unwilling
to
take
a
step
back
pause
for
a
moment
and
gain
perspective
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
student
government
at
the
University
of
Minnesota
twin
cities
a
student
senator
there
say
I
believe
he
be
concerned
have
a
moment
of
silence
in
remembrance
for
victim
of
would
cause
Islamophobia
on
campus
to
spike
that
be
absurd
argument
but
it
be
sort
of
thing
we
see
every
day
at
leadership
institutes
of
campus
reform
anything
we
should
come
together
be
moment
of
silence
for
Dartmouth
black
life
protest
get
out
of
hand
to
make
thing
worst
vice
provost
of
student
affair
side
with
protester
apologize
for
media
coverage
and
negative
response
obviously
do
not
end
so
well
when
the
head
of
the
school
get
involve
no
it
do
not
the
vice
provost
that
you
be
discuss
actually
have
to
apologize
after
the
Dartmouth
review
the
conservative
campus
paper
at
Dartmouth
actually
write
about
she
story
we
pick
it
up
in
campus
reform
so
that
be
the
sort
of
the
thing
that
be
so
disappointing
to
see
at
Dartmouth
this
be
Ivy
League
college
extremely
prestigious
school
full
of
very
smart
student
but
what
you
see
the
total
breakdown
protest
you
be
discuss
that
take
place
in
Baker
Baryalai
Blairry
include
instance
of
verbal
and
intimidation
student
be
tell
to
stand
up
and
reportedly
call

but
president
Phil
Hanlon
to

credit
say
in
a
schoolwide
email
that
the
college
be
go
to
be
look
at
all
report
incident
of
violation
of
college
policy
remain
to
be
see
exactly
what
will
come
out
of
that
at
least
administration
be
look
act
prohe
test
we
can
not
let
that
wild
and
sort
of
inincident
happen
on
campus
someone
have
to
take
control
Missouri
a
professor
resign
follow
outrage
over
he
refusal
to
cancel
the
final
exam
which
you
say
be
a
clear
setback
for
the
cause
of
academic
freedom
well
absolutely
Dale
Brigham
actually
refuse
to
cancel
the
exam
say
that
there
be
racist
bully
out
there
if
we
give
in
to
racial
intimidation
they
win
he
actually
have
a
lot
of
media
pressure
bring
on
to
he
because
he
refuse
to
cancel
class
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
attempt
to
resign
from
the
university
in
sort
of
a
protest
move
the
university
refuse
to
accept
he
resignation
this
be
extremely
well-beloved
professor
several
student
say
they
really
like
the
guy
unfortunate
that
be
the
sort
of
pressure
be
put
on
college
professor
try
to
do
they
job
if
they
ignore
the
wider
political
and
social
thing
go
on
look
what
happen
at
Yale
University
with
the
administrator
there
who
dare
to
say
that
perhaps
you
know
warn
student
that
they
should
not
wear
offensive
Halloween
costume
be
maybe
overstep
bound
of
university
push
a
little
too
far
on
free
speech
they
have
to
actually
give
up
they
teaching
position
for
the
upcoming
year
I
believe
because
they
be
so
concerned
about
whether
or
not
student
would
be
able
to
listen
to
they
they
be
you
see
the
video
of
course
there
be
viral
video
where
one
of
administrator
have
student
scream
at
he
that
he
job
be
not
to
teach
at
Yale
it
be
not
to
create
a
learn
environment
it
be
to
create
the
fabled
safe
space
one
place
you
should
feel
safe
be
college

GEICO
expect
great

and
a
whole

more
I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you

if
it
be
right
for
you
such
Al

joy
of
have
my
first
child
in
2011
come
with
the
pain
of
be
my
heaviest
weight
ever
230
pound
I
have
struggle
with
my
weight
my
entire
life
I
realize
I
have
come
to
view
certain
food
as
drug
frequently
bing
out
of
control
as
I
share
in
my
book
I
find
the
only
way
to
get
healthy
be
to
be
brutally
honest
about
my
trigger
food
all
flour
and
dairy
and
then
completely
eliminate
they
as
I
share
with
Amy
Robach
it
do
not
exist
Barbara
also
realize
food
be
she
fix
I
actually
gain
35
pound
from
binge
eating
I
do
not
recognize
my
own
body
because
I
have
never
look
like
that
in
my
life
first
I
think
it
be
enjoyable
and
then
eventually
it
real
monkey
on
you
back
she
seek
treatment
and
drop
the
pound
for
so
many
of
we
treat
binge
eating
be
the
real
key
to
lose
weight
and
finding
freedom
the
first
step
be
simply
hope
and
surrender
hope
that
be
there
a
possibility
I
might
change
and
number
two
surrender
into
a
plan
of
action
that
involve
real
treatment
for
a
real
problem
so
how
do
you
know
if
you
might
have
a
problem
with
binge
eating
well
my
book
do
have
a
questionnaire
in
it
to
provide
some
guidance
ultimately
if
you
think
you
suffer
from
this
issue
you
should
talk
to
you
doctor
awareness
be
the
first
step
so
often
we
be
tell
weight
loss
be
tell
it
be
about
discipline
and
self-control
but
for
so
many
people
it
be
about
much
more
than
this
you
do
this
once
with
you
first
baby
how
different
the
second
time
around
promote
a
weightloss
book
that
be
fun
you
know
what
be
be
important
be
habit
bad
habit
make
life
much
more
difficult
good
habit
make
it
easier
exercise
every
day
keep
up
clean
eating
you
be
spin
I
be
still
spin
every
day
and
like
you
ginger
I
be
hope
to
have
a
25-pound
baby
easiest
weight
loss
thank
you
Mara
you
can
pick
up
a
copy
of
she
book
wherever
book
be
sell
now
let
go
to
amy
all
right
girl
thank
you
and
here
with
some
advice
help
you
to
reframe
you
thinking
of
weight
loss
in
the
new
year
Jennifer
Ashton
how
you
think
about
thing
have
a
huge
impact
what
do
you
mean
about
this
no
question
we
hear
from
Mara
so
often
it
be
tell
you
willpower
and
discipline
that
be
not
true
I
look
at
thing
through
a
medical
lens
we
want
to
look
good
but
it
be
really
what
be
go
on
inside
you
body
I
be
call
it
the
three
ps
you
want
to
focus
on
you
priority
perspective
and
plan
if
you
do
that
and
really
focus
on
the
inside-out
everything
else
will
fall
into
place
but
first
p
priority
priority
when
you
think
about
it
as
a
pyramid
yes
we
care
about
what
everybody
see
you
body
need
good
food
good
fuel
good
fitness
--
so
you
do
need
to
move
--
and
you
need
rest
and
on
top
of
it
be
the
mirrorball
which
be
what
everybody
see
we
do
have
that
element
of
Vanity
yeah
if
you
do
all
these
thing
what
see
on
the
outside
will
look
good
the
next
p
be
perspective
this
be
so
important
because
it
be
very
easy
to
tend
on
focus
just
on
what
you
be
go
through
but
I
tell
patient
all
the
time
in
Med
sin
you
have
to
remember
perspective
so
look
at
this
animation
if
you
imagine
you
be
on
the
weight
loss
road
or
any
kind
of
health
change
you
be
try
to
make
you
feel
alone
there
be
ton
of
people
on
that
path
also
it
be
really
a
process
not
just
about
the
product
so
when
you
realize
you
be
not
alone
I
think
it
give
you
that
perspective
and
it
be
very
important
and
finally
you
get
to
have
a
plan
nothing
work
without
a
plan
and
the
body
will
follow
the
mind
when
you
be
think
about
make
these
change
set
a
meaningful
goal
not
I
want
to
be
a
size
whatever
in
my
jeans
it
be
I
want
to
be
healthy
I
want
my
cholesterol
to
drop
by
ten
point
anticipate
obstacle
that
real
life
do
not
let
it
derail
you
lastly
you
want
to
anticipate
all
of
those
thing
but
be
patient
with
yourself
at
the
same
time
and
reward
yourself
this
truly
be
about
you
inner
health
not
just
one
everyone
else
see
well
say
thank
you
inspiring
all
thank
you
so
much
Ashton
so
for
so
many
of
we
this
time
of
year
be
about
family
friend
and
faith
Robin
sit
down
with
pastor
Joel
Osteen
to
get
he
perspective
on
it
all
all
right
Lara
thank
you
you
know
it
be
a
new
year
new
beginning
how
can
you
get
you
year
off
to
the
best
possible
start
and
get
past
any
bump
in
the
road
one
of
America
most
popular
preacher
Joel
Ostten
be
here
to
help
we
make
the
most
of
2016
always
good
to
be
in
you
presence
and
see
you
Joel
thank
you
Robin
okay
it
be
a
new
year
you
get
to
start
with
a
clean
slate
do
not
you
I
know
it
be
a
great
time
to
let
go
of
the
old
I
have
learn
Robin
if
you
do
not
let
go
of
the
disappointment
you
will
not
receive
the
new
thing
that
God
have
in
store
so
I
think
it
be
the
perfect
time
--
we
all
look
back
you
get
to
clean
the
slate
and
God
will
give
you
a
new
beginning
but
you
have
to
do
you
part
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
go
on
in
the
world
in
one
of
you
recent
message
I
appreciate
you
say
the
economy
be
up
you
be
up
when
the
economy
be
down
you
be
down
do
not
let
other
thing
dictate
you
mood
that
be
difficult
especially
with
all
these
tragedy
shooting
that
we
have
have
recently
I
find
that
if
you
start
off
the
day
grateful
you
find
some
reason
to
be
thankful
to
be
alive
if
you
start
the
day
off
right
the
new
year
off
right
a
better
year
for
you
how
often
should
parent
talk
to
they
child
about
what
be
go
on
in
the
world
and
to
remain
hopeful
in
the
new
year
yeah
I
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
explain
to
kid
sometimes
it
be
hard
with
the
shooting
and
the
tragedy
but
I
think
it
be
important
to
explain
that
God
give
we
all
a
choice
some
people
choose
to
do
evil
and
that
be
not
the
right
way
the
way
to
overcome
that
be
to
be
bright
light
we
get
to
be
good
be
example
of
love
and
kindness
not
go
to
the
negativity
and
the
bitterness
and
pay
people
back
be
a
part
of
the
solution
not
testimony
problem
it
be
be
wonderful
to
see
family
celebrate
this
season
and
so
excited
but
I
want
to
speak
to
those
people
who
say
you
know
what
Robin
and
Joel
it
be
not
a
fun
time
for
I
you
know
I
miss
my
family
and
there
be
some
people
be
very
low
as
they
start
the
new
year
come
out
of
the
season
what
do
you
say
to
those
people
one
thing
be
important
robin
if
you
be
lonely
go
through
loss
it
be
important
to
not
sit
at
home
by
yourself
go
out
and
be
a
blessing
to
someone
else
if
you
can
call
a
friend
if
you
volunteer
somewhere
else
if
you
get
outside
of
you
yourself
and
not
just
think
my
problem
my
loneliness
my
hurt
I
think
that
pull
you
down
more
encourage
someone
to
go
out
even
if
it
be
just
open
a
door
for
a
stranger
or
bake
they
a
pie
and
something
that
you
always
have
suggest
that
have
really
work
for
I
and
my
team
you
say
be
concrete
with
what
you
want
and
put
it
up
--
when
I
be
get
ready
in
the
morning
those
positive
word
be
stare
back
at
I
put
up
those
positive
affirmation
around
you
house
I
be
bless
I
be
strong
I
be
healthy
this
be
a
good
day
I
be
grateful
to
be
alive
sometimes
that
will
remind
we
that
every
day
be
a
gift
from
God
we
can
never
get
this
day
back
never
get
this
new
year
back
so
let
make
the
most
of
it
it
be
something
to
see
those
word
to
actually
see
they
and
something
about
it
take
over
something
in
the
inside
of
you
well
that
be
just
mind
over
matter
it
be
more
than
that
it
be
part
of
you
faith
if
you
be
see
those
word
hear
those
phrase
I
be
bless
I
be
strong
I
be
creative

gravitate
toward
that
way
in
2016

get
ready

it
be
only
day
one
of
the
year
it
be
already
shape
up
to
be
a
big
one
for
Leo
DiCaprio
he
be
be
nominate
for
a
Golden
Globe
as
best
actor
in
a
drama
for
the
portrayal
of
a
fur
trapper
in
a
revenant
buzz
be
build
that
this
could
finally
be
Leonardo
year
to
take
home
he
first
academy
award
filmmaker
have
reveal
that
despite
subzero
temperature
Leo
would
act
for
hour
even
while
nearly
motionless
and
speechless
Leo
say
it
be
he
hardest
role
of
he
life
the
ultimate
silent
role
I
try
to
take
as
much
dialogue
out
and
strip
it
down
to
the
basics
it
could
be
in
a
trend
in
recent
oscar
vote
Colin
Firth
for
the
king
speech
all
prove
to
less
be
more
ginger
I
know
you
be
root
very
hard
for
Leo
--
rob
in
Titanic
I
have
Yater
year
he
have
Gilbert
back
then
I
have
so
many
Leo
story
he
be
be
nominate
five
time
for
academy
award
never
win
he
be
the
Susan
Lucci
--
yes
when
he
get
it
it
be
go
to
go
wild
I
think
people
may
assume
because
he
be
so
young
he
get
plenty
of
time
but
a
great
role
be
a
great
role
be
a
great
role
and
look
forward
to
see
that
good
thing
be
happen
listen
up
gentleman
why
you
be
pass
up
again
for
that
promotion
if
it
make
you
feel
any
better
it
may
be
because
you
be
just
too
handsome
a
study
from
the
University
of
Maryland
here
in
the
show
that
good-looking
man
be
more
likely
to
be
pass
off
for
promotion
by
male
boss
because
they
be
see
as
a
threat
that
be
right
they
be
jealous
they
get
stick
in
middle
of
the
road
post
but
they
be
view
as
competent
but
the
boss
do
not
want
that
competition
woman
on
the
other
hand
we
actually
for
a
change
positive
news
to
report
we
do
not
get
pay
as
much
but
we
be
not

really
go
to
be
caucus

will
actually
find
out
if
the
Donald
trump
phenomenon
be
real
and
lasting
and
if
it
be
not
we
will
find
out
what
be
come
up
and
who
be
go
to
take
this
thing
over
NANCY
February
1st
be
Iowa
February
9th
be
in
New
Hampshire
the
latest
these
caucus
have
be
hold
what
do
that
mean
the
race
be
freeze
until
we
see
what
can
happen
with
Donald
Trump
if
he
can
maintain
this
lead
but
race
below
the
presidential
election
be
freeze
as
well
House
and
Senate
candidate
be
wait
to
see
how
to
run
they
race
you
ask
any
republican
leader
or
strategist
the
wisest
Republicans
they
have
no
idea
what
be
go
to
happen
we
have
never
see
anything
like
this
before
they
do
not
know
if
trump
lead
about
entirely
disappear
when
folk
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
head
to
the
poll
the
poll
have
show
there
be
extreme
fluidity
in
the
race
there
always
be
the
cliche
in
Iowa
be
organize
organize
organize
and
get
hot
at
the
end
we
be
at
the
end
now
we
be
at
the
moment
of
excitement
for
underdog
this
be
what
they
have
be
say
after
the
new
year
my
moment
will
come
the
voter
be
very
fluid
and
they
will
turn
to
I
when
they
be
go
to
pick
a
president
that
be
happen
in
the
past
remember
Rick
Santorum
out
of
nowhere
to
win
the
Iowa
caucus
the
challenge
for
that
underdog
particularly
with
Iowa
the
last
two
winner
of
the
Iowa
Caucus
have
not
go
on
and
that
be
what
happen
before
Bob
Dole
win
it
and
do
not
go
on
George
Bush
win
it
and
do
not
go
on
it
be
a
chance
for
somebody
who
have
not
get
the
love
to
finally
get
the
love
with
the
voter
and
build
some
spark
to
go
on
we
have
see
surprise
on
the
democratic
side
Barack
Obama
in
2008
and
John
Kerry
in
2004
a
late
starter
who
be
able
to
organize
and
get
go
John
Kerry
be
the
patron
saint
of
long
shot
Republicans
will
say
--
they
will
not
say
this
out
loud
they
will
say
I
would
like
to
be
like
job
who
be
at
about
3
or
4
%
in
the
poll
and
then
in
part
because
he
rival
go
at
each
other
he
rise
as
they
fail
the
other
interesting
thing
when
we
get
to
the
convention
if
in
fact
it
be
Hillary
Clinton
who
will
she
choose
as
a
run
mate
and
if
in
fact
she
be
the
nominee
will
the
Republicans
feel
like
they
have
to
choose
a
woman
as
a
run
mate
I
do
not
know
I
be
not
hear
that
among
conservative
and
republican
I
remember
the
dream
team
be
Marco
Rubio
of
Florida
and
John
Kasich
of
Ohio
it
be
like
Florida
and
Ohio
oh
my
gosh
put
that
together
I
be
not
sure
they
will
feel
that
they
have
to
have
a
woman
but
I
be
sure
that
conversation
will
come
up
why
would
not
it
and
there
be
a
lot
of
good
woman
to
choose
from
there
who
be
those
republican
woman
that
would
be
at
the
top
of
the
list
I
think
the
first
person
you
will
have
to
think
of
be
Carly
Fiorina
who
be
not
huge
in
the
poll
right
now
but
who
have
make
a
rather
valiant
try
and
who
be
on
some
level
win
some
of
the
heart
I
think
of
the
party
so
she
would
certainly
be
first
consideration
I
would
think
Nicky
Hayley
governor
Martinez
Kelly
allyote
there
be
a
lot
of
reason
they
would
want
to
can
we
look
at
this
day
and
figure
out
what
the
great
debate
be
go
to
be
about
for
America
in
2016
I
think
you
have
to
assume
it
be
go
to
be
a
mix
of
economy
and
foreign
policy
you
know
in
2008
obviously
it
be
the
economy
the
economy
and
that
really
help
barack
Obama
but
I
think
we
be
go
to
see
this
ping-ponging
back
and
forth
over
the
course
of
the
next
year
between
economic
concern
and
then
when
something
happen
hopefully
it
do
not
but
when
we
have
terrible
thing
happen
either
here
at
home
or
abroad
like
San
Bernardino
that
be
go
to
come
forefront
the
interesting
thing
right
now
be
when
you
poll
republican
voter
and
ask
they
who
do
you
think
would
be
strongest
on
the
economy
they
say
Donald
Trump
and
then
when
you
ask
they
who
do
you
think
would
be
strongest
on
foreign
policy
they
say
Donald
Trump
and
so
at
least
for
right
now
he
be
sort
of
rise
above
everyone
and
normally
you
would
think
okay
he
be
get
this
huge
lead
he
be
up
by
15
point
of
course
he
be
go
to
do
well
in
the
primary
but
he
do
not
really
have
a
traditional
organization
he
do
not
have
people
staffer
work
for
he
in
these
state
precinct
captain
thing
like
that
draw
the
alternative
far
narrative
John
give
that
Republicans
change
the
number
of
debate
they
change
the
primary
schedule
make
it
more
compact
how
will
that
change
or
impact
a
potential
trump
candidacy
or
other
take
trump
out
let
go
to
the
fewer
number
of
debate
if
it
be
true
that
Donald
Trump
do
not
do
as
well
in
debate
as
he
do
in
other
venue
because
he
be
not
as
detail-oriented
and
it
be
also
a
opportunity
for
less
be
candidate
who
can
not
get
he
share
of
airtime
to
finally
get
in
front
of
the
voter
you
would
imagine
all
non-trump
candidate
would
want
more
debate
a
chance
to
shine
and
take
he
down
that
be
a
way
in
which
it
be
change
what
will
be
interesting
to
watch
we
be
talk
about
the
vice
presidential
pick
it
be
still
possible
that
because
of
the
way
the
delegate
be
proportion
and
if
the
field
stay
large
enough
you
could
and
this
be
wishful
thinking
on
the
part
of
all
political
reporter
but
you
could
have
a
situation
where
you
get
to
a
convention
and
the
nominee
do
not
have
a
majority
then
you
have
a
exciting
situation
the
Republican
Party
have
not
have
it
since
1976
people
say
Ted
Cruz
really
study
past
presidential
campaign
and
the
lesson
he
be
learn
in
term
of
organization
organization
organization
and
also
tactical
restraint
we
see
he
stay
away
from
Donald
Trump
in
a
lot
of
fight
that
he
could
have
have
and
that
work
well
for
he
so
he
have
not
only
the
organization
but
also
one
of
the
thing
candidate
who
have
run
before
they
say
they
have
learn
not
to
swing
at
every
pitch
which
be
to
say
you
need
some
discipline
the
fact
that
Cruz
have
be
able
to
stay
out
of
a
lot
of
those
fight
have
help
he
Donald
Trump
be
not
in
school
that
day
one
of
the
amazing
thing
about
trump
be
that
discipline
be
exactly
the
word
when
you
get
in
and
you
start
to
win
you
start
to
look
like
you
be
win
if
you
have
get
you
head
screw
on
right
you
develop
discipline
you
show
respect
for
everybody
by
be
discipline
you
can
have
colorful
program
and
colorful
idea
dramatic
one
but
you
put
they
forward
in
a
thoughtful
and
we-can-talk-about-it
way
it
be
amazing
that
Donald
trump
or
someone
around
he
have
not
force
he
to
exhibit
the
kind
of
discipline
that
a
winner
must
have
but
who
be
that
person
that
could
do
that
I
do
not
know
who
that
person
could
possibly
be
it
should
be
Donald
Trump
maybe
that
be
the
answer
but
I
do
not
see
how
you
do
it
without
discipline
if
it
go
to
the
convention
a
hand
to
hand
fight
on
the
convention
floor
be
about
discipline
and
have
you
troops
you
really
need
it

that
be

on

kind
of
environment
a
casino
that
look
more
like
a
arcade
than
a
nightclub
fill
with
game
of
skill
not

this
feel
much
more
like

games
than
gamble
to
I
yes

to
where
you
have
a

chance
to

skill
shoot
a

I
can
not
imagine
that
the

want
to
give
people
a
fighting
chance
to
win
money
they
be
all
go
to
change
as
you

get

you
have
to
make
sure
you
get
you
next

do
I
get
to
the
next
level
how
be
I
do
with
the
game
play
as
oppose
to
the
money
part
of
it
the
flip
side
be
they
do
not
realize
how
much

they

absolutely
possible

Nevada
gaming
regulation
in

now
allow
for
skilled
player
to
potentially
win

by
advance
further
into

but
the
downside
be
if
you
be
not
good
at
the
game
you
could
lose
even
more
often
than
at
a
game
of
chance

fifth
largest
consumer
of
wine
but
it
be
also
the
fifth
largest
producer
of
wine
and

of
million
in
investment
to
make
this
China
wine
country
I
have
be
to
other
wine
region
in
the
world
and
I
think
the
Gobi
desert
unthinkable
but
boy
it
be
a
reality
and
it
be
a
big
reality
so
big
that
wine
expert
and
author
Karen
McNeill
know
she
have
to
come
to
China

be
update
she
book
the
wine
Bible

for
magazine
and
try
to
understand
these
really
new
world
wine
I
taste
wine
a
year
and
have
for
30
year
that
be
a
lot
of
wine
that
be
a
lot
of
wine
some
woman
have
to
do
it
Seth
do
not
try
to
take
my
job
I
be
just
think
that
sound
good
so
I
have
a
good
understanding
of
when
wine
have
potential
and
when
it
do
not
we
meet
she
in
the
tasting
room
where
she
take
note
wine
importer
say
China
wine
producer
be
produce
they
own
flavor
not
just
copy
other
we
be
travel
overseas
and
bring
back
wine
culture
he
say
you
can
buy
wine
from
all
over
the
world
that
just
take
money
but
make
wine
take
expertise
see
that
take
McNeill
to
the
vineyard
where
she
tour
what
be
you
total
production
bottle
each
year
and
tasting
it
sometimes
right
from
the
barrel
2013
a
great
vintage
here
if
the
name
do
not
sound
familiar
it
will
oh
man
that
be
really
good
we
grandchild
will
probably
know
this
as
they
would
know
any
other
wine
region
in
the
world
there
be
about
acre
of
vineyard
plant
here
by
2020
they
plan
to
have
more
than
acre
that
be
more
than
three
time
the
amount
in
the
Napa
Valley
Napa
do
it
in
a
century
here
a
decade
it
be
fruity
ot
as
complex
as
french
champagne
we
sample
a
sparkling
white
this
facilitate
be
a
the
$
23
million
investment
for
LVMH
to
spend
this
kind
of
money
here
be
a
big
thumb
up
in
term
of
its
confidence
about
the
chinese
market
so
it
start
from
scratch
we
build
up
the
winery
the
vineyard
everything
he
be
the
general
manager
here
he
be
chinese
but
he
English
have
the
slightest
french
accent
I
learn
wine
make
in
France
so
I
want
to
bring
the
Savo
Savoir
Faire
to
China
he
show
we
there
be
specific
challenge
here
we
have
to
bury
the
line
every
year
every
winter
and
you
unbury
the
line
with
spring
to
protect
they
from
the
wind
from
the
wind
and
cold
cover
the
vine
each
winter
be
do
by
hand
which
drive
up
cost
then
there
be
the
question
of
sustainability
water
all
of
these
vine
in
a
desert
and
supply
can
all
of
this
wine
be
sell
it
be
really
a
risky
bet
but
I
think
the
chinese
philosophy
have
be
build
it
and
they
will
come
and
if
you
build
it
well
they
will
come
so
we
will
just
have
to
see
she
journey
to
China
in
a
word
Karen
McNeill
say
she
be
incredulous
we
think
we
know
all
the
great
wine
region
in
the
world
we
know
Tuscany
we
know
Bordeaux
we
know
Napa
the
idea
that
somewhere
in
the
chinese
desert
might
be
the
next
great
wine
region
in
the
world
it
be
astounding
chinese
wine
producer
be
say
they
be
focus
first
on
sell
to
the
domestic
chinese
market
but
say
you
should
expect
somewhere
down
the
road
to
see
chinese
wine
in
the
too
a
great
piece
by
seth
why
can
not
they
make
wine
make
wine
make
happiness
and
the
do
and
they
do

spend
less
and
pay
off

CBS

business
analyst

be
here

to

that
happen

how

we
make

those
three
goal
be
pretty

goal
they
be
the
basic
concept
of
financial
planning
obviously
save
more
pay
down
that
credit
card
debt
live
within
you
means
be
all
lofty
goal
but
also
another
part
be
pay
attention
be
engage

that
mean
figure

we
really
want
people
to
focus
on
this
especially
now
that
it
feel
like
the
recession
be
behind
we
time
to
normalize
we
life
one
way
that
the
recession
be
behind
we
be
what
the
Fed
decision
on
the
interest
rate
do
to
the
market
this
be
go
to
be
a
huge
year
for
investor
as
the
Federal
Reserve
continue
to
increase
interest
rate
market
will
react
right
now
base
on
the
future
that
be
the
bond
marketing
it
be
predict
4
rate
increase
this
year
of
a
quarter
point
each
we
will
end
the
year
with
1
%
higher
rate
Great
News
for
saver
maybe
get
better
cd
rate
not
such
great
news
for
borrower
who
may
see
the
cost
of
loan
start
to
increase
for
investor
I
do
think
it
be
go
to
be
a
dicey
year
what
if
you
have
a
mortgage
if
you
have
a
30-year
fixed
rate
mortgage
that
be
terrific
if
you
have
a
adjustable
rate
mortgage
you
cost
be
go
to
crevasse
rate
inch
higher
but
rate
be
still
low
now
may
be
a
good
time
to
convert
that
adjustable
rate
mortgage
into
a
fixed
rate
why
not
make
you
life
easier
and
do
that
no
complain
if
you
mortgage
rate
go
from
4
to
4
fi5
%
I
never
think
a
adjustable
rate
mortgage
be
a
good
idea
I
be
freak
out
by
a
adjustable
rate
mortgage
when
I
be
buy
my
house
when
interest
rate
be
low
and
you
know
you
be
go
to
leave
within
five
to
seven
year
fantastic
I
be
go
to
be
go
to
a
different
place
I
be
go
to
mobile
I
be
not
stay
in
this
house
that
be
fine
but
for
most
people
we
recommend
a
fixed
rate
be
this
a
good
year
to
buy
a
house
this
be
the
year
have
more
people
be
go
to
be
able
to
buy
a
house
last
year
we
do
not
have
a
lot
of
house
for
sale
the
inventory
be
quite
low
we
be
see
more
house
come
on
the
market
in
2016
hopefully
price
stay
reasonable
with
rate
low
I
think
that
be
a
very
good
thing
for
most
homeowner
what
about
irs
change
for
retirement
in
2016
no
change
how
about
that
you
be
still
at
a
lot
of
people
say
to
I
they
do
not
move
it
higher
very
few
people
be
put
$
a
year
away
if
you
can
try
to
put
that
retirement
account
up
by
a
percentage
or
two
put
the
account
on
auto-rebalance
make
this
automatic
make
sure
you
do
not
let
you
emotion
get
away
from
you

look
like
the
map
of
the
world
Syria
Afghanistan
Iraq
Sudan
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
it
be
true
I
do
not
think
about
it
but
yeah
it
be
true
we
be
walk
through
the
refugee
camp
just
outside
of
Calais
as
we
walk
some
people
just
pass
we
some
people
stop
and
look
and
occasionally
people
stop
to
talk
but
we
have
be
warn
over
and
over
that
people
do
not
want
they
face
show
they
be
afraid
they
be
afraid
of
be
target
here
and
they
be
afraid
they
family
will
be
target
at
home
it
be
very
cold
and
overcast
it
be
just
rain
so
it
be
very
muddy
and
it
look
like
it
be
go
to
be
rain
again
do
you
want
to
say
you
name
my
name
be
Sidiq
Husain
Khil
and
I
be
from
Afghanistan
when
do
you
come
here
I
be
here
since
month
and
why
do
you
come
here
I
want
to
go
to
because
in
Afghanistan
you
better
know
the
situation
be
very
bad
and
America
come
there
they
want
to
finish
al-Qaeda
and
terrorism
but
they
be
unsuccessful
in
that
instead
of
that
to
finish
the
terrorism
they
increase
the
war
in
Afghanistan
and
the
people
be
in
a
very
bad
situation
it
be
all
because
of
America
where
do
you
come
from
in
Afghanistan
I
come
from
Kunar
what
be
it
like
be
it
destroy
be
it
bomb
yeah
Kunar
be
totally
destroy
and
a
big
group
of
Americans
be
there
there
be
a
big
base
and
still
Kunar
be
under
bombing
from
--
even
from
pakistani
side
all
area
of
Kunar
be
each
day
and
every
day
the
Pakistan
be
bombing
on
Kunar
and
at
that
time
be
also
american
be
bombing
there
because
from
the
past
the
people
of
Kunar
be
all
like
--
you
know
they
be
religious
people
all
of
they
like
that
be
the
--
this
be
the
main
center
of
Taliban
why
do
you
think
they
be
bombing
because
they
say
these
people
be
Taliban
they
be
terrorist
Americans
be
bombing
there
and
Pakistan
be
also
bombing
there
Pakistan
think
that
the
Taliban
be
hide
here
and
they
be
think
that
Osama
be
also
there
and
the
hezb-e
Islami
leader
Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar
be
also
there
that
be
why
Kunar
be
mostly
under
attack
be
there
drone
strike
in
Kunar
yes
there
be
drone
attack
and
what
effect
do
they
have
do
you
know
people
kill
they
be
always
kill
innocent
people
they
be
bombing
on
the
civilian
on
the
village
in
fact
they
be
not
Taliban
many
time
they
kill
civilian
there
and
how
do
that
make
people
feel
they
make
people
unhappy
disappointed
from
both
side
--
from
government
and
from
the
--
from
the
whole
world
from
America
from
all
the
people
al-Qaeda
Daesh
do
you
think
it
increase
since
2001
since
2001
yeah
because
you
know
if
they
be
bombing
on
civilian
--
America
or
the
NATO
or
all
these
group
--
if
they
be
bombing
on
civilian
civilian
become
very
angry
and
they
join
the
group
of
Taliban
that
be
why
if
they
be
kill
one
person
or
10
person
100
of
they
be
join
the
group
of
Taliban
they
do
not
support
the
government
because
government
can
not
help
they
so
be
you
say
the
bombing
increase
terrorism
yes
the
war
be
not
the
solution
for
finish
terrorism
they
have
to
talk
face
by
face
what
be
they
demand
you
know
look
to
the
Syria
the
whole
world
be
bombing
daesh
but
they
be
increase
they
can
not
do
anything
when
do
you
actually
leave
Afghanistan
I
leave
Afghanistan
in
--
I
think
in
August
I
do
not
know
five
six
month
ago
and
how
do
you
make
you
way
out
it
be
a
big
story
it
be
very
difficult
you
know
everyone
know
I
come
to
Iran
then
after
that
I
come
to
Turkey
after
that
I
come
to
Bulgaria
do
you
drive
do
you
walk
do
you
--
we
--
sometimes
we
be
in
bus
sometimes
we
be
walk
in
the
mountain
when
we
be
cross
the
border
so
from
Bulgaria
to
where
from
Bulgaria
to
Serbistan
to
to
Serbia
and
then
then
to
Hungary
and
then
then
to
Austria
and
then
and
then
you
know
to
Italia
France
and
now
I
be
here
it
be
a
very
very
long
trip
it
be
a
--
yeah
of
course
it
be
a
very
long
trip
it
be
not
that
easy
just
to
buy
the
ticket
of
airplane
and
go
to
the
airport
sit
in
the
plane
and
come
directly
here
we
be
just
illegally
cross
the
border
and
that
be
very
difficult
a
very
difficult
task
we
lose
many
of
we
friend
they
lose
they
--
they
pass
away
they
lose
they
life
and
some
of
the
people
they
be
not
with
we
now
and
you
family
be
you
family
with
you
here
no
my
family
be
not
here
where
be
you
family

should
be
do

I
tell
you
you
know
be
just
increase
the
war
actually
do

--
behind
there
be
they
profit
they
benefit

a
few
of
the
thousand

strand
in
the

it
be
common
for
score

nightly
hide

have
pledge
to

the
majority

extend

there
be
nearly
60
million
people
forcibly
displace
worldwide
the
largest
number
since
World
War
II
special
thanks
to
democracy
now
Laura
Gottesdiener
Nermeen
Shaikh
Hany
Massoud
and
Denis
Moynihan
when
we
come
back
from
break
we
speak
with
a
french
journalist
hold
hostage
by
isil
for
more
than
10
month
stay
with
we
border
by
this
be
democracy
now
the
war
and
peace
report
I
be
Amy
Goodman
while
democracy
now
be
in
France
for
the
climate
summit
I
interview
french
journalist
Nicolas
Hénin
he
be
hold
hostage
by
the
self-proclaimed
islamic
state
inside
Syria
for
10
month
spend
much
of
that
time
lock
up
in
a
dungeon
he
be
hold
alongside
journalist
James
Foley
and
Steven
Sotloff
who
be
later
behead
they
death
be
videotape
and
air
across
the
world
while
he
be
hold
hostage
Nicolas
Hénin
also
briefly
meet
american
aid
worker
Kayla
Mueller
who
also
die
in
captivity
possibly
from
a
coalition
airstrike
Nicolas
Hénin
be
release
in
April
2014
along
with
three
other
french
journalist
I
begin
by
ask
Nicolas
if
airstrike
be
the
answer
to
combate
the
islamic
state
airstrike
in
Syria
the
way
they
be
do
be
a
mistake
I
be
not
say
that
we
country
should
deprive
themselves
from
any
military
option
no
the
military
action
should
remain
in
the
panel
of
the
strategy
it
should
be
keep
as
one
way
to
counter
terrorism
but
the
point
be
that
in
a
counterterrorism
strategy
the
military
shall
remain
a
very
little
part
of
the
overall
strategy
because
eventually
what
kind
of
fight
be
we
fight
that
be
a
fight
for
propaganda
so
basically
the
side
that
will
--
the
party
that
will
win
this
war
be
not
the
party
that
will
fight
harder
or
have
the
most
expensive
or
newest
weaponry
or
the
bravest
fighter
it
will
be
the
party
that
will
manage
to
have
the
people
on
its
side
and
the
problem
be
that
with
all
these
bombing
--
because
everybody
at
the
moment
be
bombing
Syria
--
all
of
these
bombing
have
a
terrible
side
effect
and
basically
we
--
Westerners
but
not
only
Westerners
also
the
Russians
also
the
regime
--
be
push
the
syrian
people
into
the
hand
of
Isis
we
be
work
for
they
we
be
recruit
for
they
so
I
be
not
say
no
absolutely
for
any
strike
but
strike
should
remain
minimal
because
we
should
keep
in
mind
what
be
the
consequence
and
the
side
effect
of
they
you
have
call
they
these
strike
a
trap
yes
very
much
and
I
call
they
especially
in
the
french
environment
because
just
two
month
ago
president
Hollande
the
french
president
advocate
for
the
strike
and
he
announce
to
my
fellow
countryman
that
these
strike
be
aim
at
secure
we
country
at
make
it
safer
because
he
say
it
be
better
to
fight
the
terrorist
of
Isis
there
in
Syria
so
that
we
do
not
have
to
fight
they
here
at
home
and
what
be
the
consequence
we
have
see
with
the
Paris
attack
that
these
strike
probably
contribute
to
designate
we
the
french
people
even
further
as
a
target
for
Isis
so
these
strike
be
counterproductive
so
what
be
the
answer
Nicolas
the
answer
be
to
engage
the
people
to
address
especially
they
cry
for
--
they
desperate
call
for
freedom
democracy
and
first
of
all
on
a
very
short
term
security
over
the
last
year
syrian
people
have
be
massacre
at
the
pace
of
200
people
per
day
that
be
even
higher
than
the
death
toll
of
the
Paris
attack
this
be
something
we
have
to
address
first
because
these
200
people
kill
every
day
be
the
reason
for
the
--
the
primary
reason
for
the
success
of
Isis
talk
about
what
happen
to
you
in
June
of
2013
bad
bad
memory
I
mean
I
--
it
be
--
I
be
just
take
and
I
--
where
be
you
I
be
in
Raqqa
so
one
of
the
--
well
the
syrian
capital
city
of
the
islamic
state
and
I
be
report
that
be
my
fifth
trip
to
Syria
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
and
they
have
take
I
I
try
to
escape
on
the
third
day
so
of
course
they
be
not
happy
and
I
have
be
move
and
move
and
move
and
also
some
people
have
be
move
with
I
and
eventually
we
find
out
be
two
dozen
Westerners
hostage
together
journalist
or
aid
worker
why
do
you
open
you
book
with
James
Foley
James
be
the
first
to
be
murder
and
that
be
a
trauma
a
personal
trauma
to
I
but
also
a
trauma
for
the
world
and
this
be
why
I
open
my
book
with
he
because
the
aim
of
the
islamic
state
by
murder
he
be
to
open
a
trap
wide
open
and
under
we
foot
they
want
to
impose
they
agenda
on
we
they
want
to
stone
us
that
we
be
so
much
shock
that
we
stop
act
rationally
because
you
know
amy
there
be
something
very
specific
with
a
terror
action
the
success
the
completion
of
a
terrorist
attack
do
not
depend
on
its
perpetrator
but
it
depend
on
its
victim
the
beautiful
example
for
that
be
the
aftermath
of
I
mean
how
do
the
Bush
administration
react
after
we
have
the
invasion
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
that
later
become
the
birthplace
of
the
islamic
state
we
have
Guantánamo
extraordinary
rendition
and
the
patriot
act
I
mean
one
must
be
totally
stupid
to
believe
that
we
punish
Osama
bin
Laden
and
al-Qaeda
invade
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
and
even
the
opposite
--
the
real
success
on
this
be
not
the
collapse
of
the
twin
tower
the
real
success
of
this
be
the
invasion
of
Afghanistan
and
Iraq
and
this
be
not
make
by
the
terrorist
this
success
be
only
due
to
the
victim
the
Americans
be
victim
of
the
terrorist
but
they
offer
to
they
aggressor
they
success
and
this
be
something
that
we
shall
always
keep
in
mind
every
time
we
be
hit
by
a
major
terrorist
attack
--
what
want
we
aggressor
we
to
do
what
would
you
like
I
to
do
and
how
shall
I
react
to
displease
he
ISIL
hostage
french
journalist
Nicolas
Hénin
we
will
be
back
with
he
in
a
minute
this
be
democracy
now
the
war
and
peace
report
I
be
Amy
Goodman
as
we
return
to
we
conversation
with
french
journalist
ISIL
hostage
Nicolas
Hénin
he
be
hold
hostage
in
Syria
by
the
self-proclaimed
islamic
state
for
10
month
I
ask
he
about
journalist
James
Foley
who
be
behead
in
August
2014
four
month
after
henin
be
release
when
James
Foley
be
behead
how
do
you
find
out
where
be
he
behead
well
it
be
--
I
recognize
the
place
because
these
be
valley
where
I
run
when
I
escape
I
actually
run
very
close
from
this
place
on
the
night
I
escape
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
captivity
so
I
recognize
the
landscape
and
I
be
of
course
very
much
shock
because
I
do
not
believe
that
that
would
happen
I
be
still
maybe
a
bit
naïve
but
we
fill
ourselves
with
hope
with
desperate
hope
during
these
month
of
captivity
we
have
to
hope
because
if
you
stop
hope
then
you
have
no
reason
to
survive
so
that
be
maybe
a
bit
naive
to
believe
that
yes
for
some
of
we
it
may
be
a
bit
more
difficult
than
for
other
but
that
we
would
eventually
all
of
we
make
it
out
and
he
murder
be
the
evidence
that
that
be
not
true
and
that
actually
some
of
we
some
of
we
group
would
not
make
it
out
how
do
you
ultimately
get
free
Nicolas
well
I
believe
that
there
have
be
negotiation
for
that
I
do
not
know
the
term
of
the
negotiation
I
do
not
know
what
I
have
be
exchange
for
the
only
thing
I
know
be
what
the
french
authority
what
president
Hollande
tell
I
that
the
french
government
do
not
pay
any
money
so
I
do
not
know
anything
else
so
what
happen
after
10
month
you
be
hold
and
then
tell
we
about
the
day
you
be
free
well
it
be
a
bit
strange
I
mean
I
be
--
we
be
move
to
a
different
jail
away
from
the
group
we
have
to
speak
on
the
day
before
we
be
say
well
you
will
be
free
so
and
we
have
to
speak
for
the
first
time
with
Kayla
Mueller
for
five
minute
and
--
what
do
you
mean
you
have
to
speak
to
Kayla
she
--
they
bring
we
to
she
cell
so
we
have
five
minute
of
exchange
because
obviously
they
want
we
to
report
that
she
be
with
we
and
alive
and
--
what
do
you
say
to
Kayla
what
be
you
conversation
well
she
explain
a
bit
what
she
have
be
through
what
do
she
say
she
say
that
she
--
she
be
look
extremely
brave
I
mean
she
be
incredibly
courageous
she
that
at
that
--
she
at
that
time
I
do
not
believe
that
she
have
be
mishandle
yet
apparently
she
have
be
afterwards
rape
and
abuse
maybe
but
she
spend
several
month
in
isolation
and
she
--
but
she
be
impressive
she
have
a
beautiful
inner
strength
I
mean
she
be
strong
inside
she
obviously
have
be
through
some
tough
moment
but
she
manage
very
well
to
overcome
they
I
be
just
impressed
she
be
look
beautiful
she
be
strong
she
be
--
I
mean
to
the
point
that
Jihadi
John
believe
that
she
convert
to
Islam
and
she
say
oh
I
just
want
to
correct
you
I
do
not
convert
and
I
mean
no
one
would
dare
to
contradict
he
but
she
do
that
be
not
aggressive
she
be
just
like
no
please
let
I
correct
you
I
do
not
convert
and
she
be
just
like
that
very
calm
but
very
decide
and
she
even
speak
to
we
a
few
word
of
french
because
she
french
be
actually
quite
good
and
she
--
yeah
she
be
really
impressive
and
who
be
you
release
with
with
--
we
be
four
french
journalist
together
and
we
have
be
release
together
and
they
just
after
some
day
in
a
transit
place
drive
we
to
the
turkish
border
and
then
deliver
we
to
the
turkish
military
be
there
other
woman
hold
there
yes
there
be
a
few
woman
but
they
be
in
a
separate
cell
and
do
you
know
who
they
be
yes
who
be
they
I
can
not
say
because
these
case
be
under
blackout
blackout
because
because
of
they
will
and
the
will
of
they
employer
and
family
we
just
come
from
Calais
about
two
hour
north
of
Paris
there
be
thousand
and
thousand
of
refugee
there
talk
about
the
largest
explosion
of
refugee
since
World
War
II
and
how
the
West
be
deal
with
they
well
this
huge
flow
of
refugee
be
a
major
recruiting
argument
for
populist
political
party
across
Europe
and
that
be
another
trap
because
actually
this
refugee
crisis
be
a
major
blow
to
the
islamic
state
and
to
its
propaganda
because
what
do
the
islamic
state
propaganda
rely
on
first
they
say
western
society
be
not
suitable
for
a
muslim
to
live
in
a
muslim
should
immigrate
to
a
muslim
land
and
preferably
to
the
caliphate
because
this
caliphate
that
we
be
establish
be
the
dream
land
for
all
Muslims
and
the
other
aspect
--
the
other
key
point
of
Isis
propaganda
be
base
on
the
fact
that
Westerners
marginalize
muslim
that
there
be
racism
and
hatred
and
basically
what
have
we
witness
last
summer
first
hundred
of
thousand
of
Muslims
flee
this
dream
land
of
Syria
it
be
like
--
it
be
just
like
if
you
have
load
of
Jews
flee
Israel
just
a
couple
of
year
after
the
state
of
Israel
be
establish
I
mean
that
be
a
--
it
contradict
all
of
the
speech
the
state
be
base
on
and
contract
itself
on
and
not
only
that
so
they
leave
this
land
of
sham
that
be
dream
land
for
Isis
to
immigrate
to
land
of
unbeliever
and
on
top
of
that
they
be
welcome
with
open
arm
by
the
western
society
who
--
and
by
many
people
in
Europe
who
say
well
you
be
we
brother
and
we
will
protect
you
and
that
be
so
much
a
blow
that
I
believe
that
one
of
the
reason
behind
the
Paris
attack
be
to
disrupt
this
and
to
stop
to
make
we
close
we
door
to
the
refugee
because
actually
welcome
refugee
be
not
a
terror
threat
to
we
to
we
country
it
be
like
a
vaccine
to
protect
we
from
terrorism
because
the
more
interaction
we
have
between
society
between
community
the
less
there
will
be
tension
I
mean
the
islamic
state
believe
in
a
global
confrontation
what
they
want
eventually
be
civil
war
in
we
country
or
at
least
large
unrest
and
in
the
Middle
East
a
large-scale
war
this
be
what
they
look
for
this
be
what
they
struggle
for
so
we
have
to
kill
they
narrative
and
actually
to
welcome
refugee
totally
destroy
they
narrative
and
if
you
kill
they
narrative
it
be
even
more
efficient
than
if
you
drop
some
bomb
and
kill
some
of
they
fighter
Marine
Le
pen
the
far-right
national
front
party
here
in
France
have
just
surge
in
the
election
yesterday
now
these
be
regional
election
she
--
she
base
be
Calais
what
do
this
mean
well
she
actually
benefit
a
lot
from
the
recent
event
of
course
one
of
the
reason
for
this
surge
be
the
high
unemployment
rate
that
we
have
in
France
and
the
economic
crisis
that
be
continue
but
she
benefit
a
lot
from
first
the
refugee
crisis
with
a
surge
also
in
xenophobia
and
she
be
very
much
islamophobic
and
she
play
with
that
and
the
second
event
be
the
Paris
attack
she
play
with
the
fear
of
the
people
can
you
talk
about
the
rise
of
the
national
front
and
the
rise
of
Isis
well
it
be
surprising
to
see
the
parallel
somehow
and
some
kind
of
shared
interest
between
Isis
and
the
national
front
it
can
sound
a
bit
provocative
to
say
it
like
that
but
the
point
be
that
definitely
the
Paris
attack
just
a
few
week
before
the
first
round
of
these
election
that
have
see
the
surge
of
the
national
front
be
--
well
these
event
be
probably
related
just
like
this
surge
be
probably
also
related
to
the
refugee
crisis
and
--
because
marine
Le
pen
just
like
all
of
the
populist
leader
across
Europe
play
a
lot
with
the
fear
of
the
people
follow
this
refugee
crisis
they
pretend
that
this
influx
of
refugee
threaten
we
identity
that
it
would
jeopardize
we
security
this
be
totally
stupid
I
mean
you
know
in
France
we
will
welcome
this
year
between
to
refugee
we
be
a
country
of
almost
70
million
inhabitant
I
be
in
Sweden
last
week
they
have
9
million
inhabitant
they
will
welcome
refugee
this
year
alone
I
mean
and
they
be
not
afraid
for
they
identity
they
be
not
afraid
for
they
security
they
be
just
--
well
they
be
just
concern
well
with
the
accommodation
of
all
these
people
and
more
--
much
more
logistical
and
practical
concern
and
issue
but
they
--
I
mean
we
could
welcome
even
more
refugee
than
we
be
welcome
and
actually
welcome
refugee
be
a
beautiful
way
to
fight
the
islamic
state
because
because
this
kill
they
narrative
because
all
they
narrative
be
base
on
the
fact
that
they
be
build
the
holy
land
for
Muslims
in
they
caliphate
self-proclaimed
caliphate
on
one
way
and
it
be
make
also
on
the
Islamophobia
I
hear
you
know
during
my
time
in
captivity
once
a
discussion
between
french-speaking
Jihadis
so
probably
french
and
--
or
maybe
of
mix
of
french
and
belgian
and
that
discussion
be
about
Islamophobia
in
Europe
and
obviously
Islamophobia
be
one
of
the
main
reason
for
which
they
decide
to
join
the
islamic
state
because
many
of
the
people
the
islamic
state
fighter
go
there
and
join
the
group
in
a
attempt
to
kind
of
restore
the
muslim
pride
do
you
feel
the
jihadis
be
steep
in
Islam
very
little
and
by
the
way
most
of
the
jihadis
I
know
either
that
I
meet
during
my
time
in
captivity
or
that
I
follow
on
the
social
media
or
exchange
with
on
the
social
media
afterwards
be
just
new
Muslims
I
mean
they
either
convert
or
they
be
kind
of
born-again
muslim
so
to
be
provocative
a
good
muslim
will
not
become
a
jihadi
I
do
not
meet
any
jihadi
who
have
a
religious
childhood
and
religion
be
always
kind
of
a
vaccine
--
can
you
say
vaccine
and
religion
seem
to
be
always
almost
a
vaccine
against
terrorism
because
a
good
religious
people
will
never
become
a
terrorist
you
message
to
the
republican
presidential
candidate
now
Donald
Trump
and
other
who
be
say
the
refugee
flow
must
be
cut
off
well
they
be
play
the
game
of
Isis
they
be
just
play
it
so
--
because
because
they
--
welcome
refugee
be
kind
of
a
vaccine
against
terrorism
and
why
so
many
jihadist
come
from
France
that
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
maybe
because
of
the
proximity
of
the
--
of
Syria
it
be
not
difficult
to
travel
from
France
to
Syria
from
Western
Europe
to
Syria
and
also
it
be
probably
a
problem
of
sociology
it
be
probably
also
the
result
of
social
problem
that
we
can
have
in
France
it
be
also
probably
to
some
extent
the
result
of
bad
policy
with
indeed
some
marginalization
of
Muslims
and
there
have
be
likely
some
failure
as
well
from
the
security
service
what
would
you
say
to
young
Europeans
who
want
to
join
who
what
to
become
jihadist
this
be
a
very
important
message
basically
Isis
will
recruit
you
tell
you
jihad
be
cool
because
yes
it
be
cool
if
you
have
no
life
no
girlfriend
no
job
no
money
nothing
in
you
home
country
and
Isis
promise
you
what
adventure
engagement
a
girl
a
car
a
weapon
power
money
whatever
so
they
all
play
like
jihad
be
cool
and
my
answer
be
--
Isis
be
a
scam
because
isis
do
not
really
fight
Assad
do
not
protect
the
Muslims
in
Syria
but
kill
to
wide
extent
a
number
of
Muslims
in
Syria
Isis
be
a
disaster
for
the
syrian
people
so
for
those
who
want
to
join
Isis
I
tell
they
I
understand
the
reason
for
you
rage
because
yes
there
be
many
reason
actually
to
be
unhappy
about
both
you
life
in
the
West
or
both
the
situation
in
Syria
and
these
civilian
be
massacre
in
huge
number
but
Isis
will
just
make
you
make
this
crisis

on

day
now
back
to
Savannah
we
be
get
2016
start
by
look
ahead
to
the
year
in
politics
and
the
fight
against
terror
as
well
as
the
economy
as
we
mention

Chuck
Todd
be
NBC
political
director
and
moderator
of
meet
the
press
happy
new
year
good
to
see
you
finally
this
be
the
election
year
everybody
be
talk
about
it
it
be
still
fluid
before
we
get
to
the
individual
in
the
race
Chuck
at
what
point
in
the
coming
year
will
thing
start
to
really
take
shape
to
take
a
long
while
it
may
be
until
after
the
convention
it
may
be
finally
in
labor
day
it
will
take
shape
this
be
the
culmination
of
15
year
of
voter
anger
and
mistrust
and
it
be
all
culminate
in
this
career
this
be
why
we
have
Donald
Trump
let
get
specific
about
that
by
the
way
last
year
at
this
time
Donald
Trump
be
not
on
you
list
of
people
that
we
would
talk
about
we
do
not
take
it
seriously
it
be
amazing
to
see
how
he
dominate
the
political
calendar
so
the
question
be
what
be
he
path
to
nomination
it
be
to
keep
win
he
be
simple
because
there
be
so
many
force
try
to
stop
he
if
he
be
at
all
short
a
party
will
do
whatever
it
take
prevent
he
from
get
the
nomination
he
be
not
ever
go
to
be
a
compromise
candidate
he
be
not
go
to
see
people
rally
around
he
side
to
say
he
be
better
than
the
decision
have
be
make
so
he
have
to
win
despite
the
force
stop
he
if
we
talk
about
Ted
Cruz
then
he
be
also
a
controversial
figure
even
within
the
Republican
Party
do
you
see
he
as
some
kind
of
a
compromise
I
do
not
but
trump
make
he
look
that
way
if
there
be
no
donald
trump
we
would
be
talk
about
the
top
Ted
Cruz
movement
in
the
party
and
everything
it
would
take
to
stop
Ted
Cruz
from
get
the
nomination
which
have
the
establishment
panic
we
can
not
kill
they
both
people
say
I
can
not
believe
we
might
have
to
accept
the
idea
of
a
Cruz
nomination
but
here
be
what
one
Republican
say
to
I
at
least
you
know
on
any
give
day
what
Cruz
might
say
and
you
can
prepare
for
it
in
advance
yes
he
may
be
too
far
to
the
right
to
win
a
general
election
but
he
will
at
least
be
discipline
and
they
think
--
trump
you
have
no
idea
what
he
might
say
early
state
be
important
let
talk
about
Marco
Rubio
perhaps
he
be
the
Republican
that
Hillary
Clinton
campaign
fear
the
most
how
long
can
he
go
without
win
it
depend
on
how
he
finish
look
he
can
make
progress
if
it
be
3rd
in
Iowa
2nd
in
New
Hampshire
and
it
look
like
it
be
a
movement
Bill
Clinton
do
it
this
way
he
do
not
win
either
Iowa
or
New
Hampshire
he
make
progress
and
2nd
be
a
victor
for
he
but
he
have
to
win
somewhere
eventually
you
have
to
start
win
I
think
he
have
make
a
mistake
and
we
will
see
if
this
month
play
out
differently
he
make
a
mistake
almost
cedee
Iowa
to
Cruz
I
do
not
know
if
anybody
can
stop
he
fewer
question
on
the
democratic
side
I
want
to
go
to
the
last
12
month
of
the
Obama
Presidency
what
might
we
expect
to
see
from
president
Obama
that
he
would
really
want
to
be
part
of
he
legacy
well
it
be
funny
we
be
go
week
we
will
have
a
earlier
than
ever
state
of
the
union
and
I
have
be
promise
that
it
will
be
unlike
any
state
of
the
union
we
have
ever
see
it
be
not
go
to
be
you
typical
laundry
list
of
what
he
be
go
to
try
to
do
it
be
go
to
be
something
different
and
something
bigger
in
some
way
try
to
set
the
table
for
what
he
think
should
be
a
bigger
conversation
for
16
we
will
see
if
he
can
pull
it
off
I
hear
president
before
say
we
be
go
to
redo
how
the
state
of
the
union
be
do
but
here
why
it
do
matter
base
upon
how
voter
feel
about
Barrack
Obama
on
election
day
if
he
be
below
45
%
job
approval
she
probably
do
not
win
get
comfortable
in
that
chair
you
will
be
here
a
lot
in
the
come
year
chuck
thank
you
another
big
issue
in
the
election
and
2016
the
threat
from
Isis
here
at
home
and
also
overseas
Richard
Engle
be
NBC
chief
foreign
correspondent
Richard
good
morning
to
you
happy
new
year
it
be
good
to
be
with
you
happy
new
year
with
you
I
wish
there
be
happier
news
on
the
foreign
policy
front
let
talk
about
this
fight
against
Isis
what
a
consequential
year
we
have
just
be
through
from
the
military
standpoint
what
do
you
think
2016
hold
well
I
think
2015
be
a
tough
year
and
we
see
the
military
increasingly
involve
very
reluctantly
but
steadily
involve
in
Iraq
and
Syria
it
start
out
with
a
few
advisors
go
to
Iraq
and
then
air
strike
in
Iraq
and
then
air
strike
in
Syria
and
ultimately
special
force
be
deploy
to
both
country
and
I
think
in
the
year
ahead
in
2016
we
be
go
to
see
more
involvement
that
this
steady
encroachment
be
probably
go
to
keep
go
what
do
you
think
about
this
coalition
I
mean
in
2015
we
see
other
country
pull
into
this
like
never
before
do
you
think
the
coalition
have
a
fight
chance
of
really
get
together
and
really
make
a
impact
that
be
the
one
thing
I
be
some
what
hopeful
for
everyone
now
sort
of
accept
that
isis
be
a
universal
threat
you
have
Iran
say
that
Russia
say
that
the
United
States
believe
that
yet
there
be
no
unified
policy
I
think
go
forward
logic
will
somehow
have
to
prevail
and
that
even
these
rival
will
have
to
agree
at
least
in
principle
that
they
need
to
coordinate
they
effort
a
little
bit
better
to
try
to
defeat
this
common
enemy
I
hope
that
logic
prevail
in
2016
we
will
see
if
it
do
but
the
thorniest
part
of
that
of
course
be
what
be
go
to
happen
to
Bashar
Al
Assad
in
Syria
and
there
be
be
this
to
manage
a
political
solution
there
what
do
you
think
we
can
expect
this
year
on
that
I
think
it
go
back
to
agree
at
least
to
fight
Isis
if
everyone
Iran
Russia
and
the
United
States
and
Saudi
Arabia
and
other
country
can
agree
that
be
a
principle
that
they
all
need
to
do
that
together
by
accept
that
they
will
also
be
accept
that
the
question
of
Bashar
Al
Assad
do
need
to
be
deal
with
but
probably
need
to
be
deal
with
later
on
in
the
year
we
will
not
hear
a
lot
of
talk
about
Bashar
Al
Assad
instead
they
will
talk
about
fight
Isis
fight
Isis
together
but
the
assumption
will
be
once
Isis
start
to
get
weaken
then
you
will
have
to
address
one
of
the
root
cause
of
Isis
which
be
Bashar
Al
Assad
continued
presence
and
if
Isis
be
weaken
and
there
be
progress
make
on
that
front
then
you
might
see
more
international
consensus
to
off
ramp
Bashar
Al
Assad
so
much
to
talk
to
you
about
we
will
be
speak
to
you
a
lot
this
year
of
course
thank
you
for
you
time
and
Matt
over
to
you
Savannah
thanks
very
much
what
do
the
new
year
have
in
store
for
you
bottom
line
from
interest
rate
to
technology
gas
price
Olivia
stearns
be
here
with
the
financial
forecast
for
the
happy
new
year
to
you
happy
new
year
can
we
say
the
end
of
2015
get
swallow
up
in
politics
and
the
economy
take
a
backseat
so
before
we
move
forward
what
be
you
economic
headline
for
the
past
year
I
would
say
the
headline
be
unemployment
finally
come
back
down
to
5
%
more
and
more
people
start
get
a
raise
and
gas
fall
to
$
2
a
gallon
that
be
good
news
solid
year
for
Main
Street
I
want
to
get
back
to
gas
price
in
a
second
but
the
other
elephant
in
the
room
be
interest
rate
up
slightly
higher
for
the
first
time
in
a
decade
why
be
this
the
time
to
do
it
how
will
it
impact
we
so
the
Fed
be
basically
say
that
we
be
finally
ready
to
take
the
training
wheel
off
the
economy
these
0
%
interest
rate
they
put
in
place
in
the
depths
of
the
crisis
it
be
a
emergency
measure
and
after
7
year
they
be
say
the
economy
improve
enough
GDP
be
grow
at
%
they
think
we
be
read
do
do
away
with
ultra
low
rate
and
they
be
raise
they
a
bit
but
a
lot
of
people
say
that
could
stall
the
economy
it
be
a
middle
ground
for
sure
that
be
why
they
wait
so
long
to
do
this
it
be
go
to
be
incremental
the
big
risk
be
they
raise
they
too
far
too
fast
and
overturn
the
apple
cart
you
bring
up
gas
price
a
second
go
let
go
back
there
because
they
be
at
incredible
low
compare
to
the
past
decade
or
so
how
long
be
that
go
to
last
good
news
be
expert
say
you
oil
be
hover
around
$
40
barrel
18
month
ago
it
be
$
80
so
it
have
come
down
really
far
really
fast
and
economist
say
because
we
be
produce
more
and
more
oil
here
at
home
and
demand
globally
slow
down
and
China
be
slow
down
we
can
get
use
to
cheap
gas
it
be
a
big
win
for
american
shopper
and
american
manufacturer
and
good
news
for
the
car
company
one
risk
though
energy
job
that
be
be
a
big
driver
of
job
growth
here
in
the
if
technology
be
a
important
part
of
the
economy
what
be
the
technology
headline
go
to
be
all
the
buzz
be
about
these
unicorn
that
be
what
we
call
start
up
company
value
at
more
than
a
billion
dollar
and
I
be
think
of
company
such
as
airbnb
and
Uber
they
have
these
astronomical
evaluation
a
all
of
they
come
out
of
the
share
economy
the
thing
be
there
be
a
lot
of
legal
question
around
they
business
model
so
nobody
can
really
say
what
they
be
worth
so
stay
tune
to
those
company
so
big
question
mark
on
those
big
question
mark
come
to
technology
everybody
be
walk
around
with
these
--
I
do
not
want
to
use
brand
name
but
these
wearable
these
piece
of
technology
on
you
wrist
they
have
a
big
future
seem
so
2015
the
year
that
they
go
mainstream
so
fitbit
that
company
be
grow
gangbuster
they
go
public
and
2015
be
the
year
that
apple
finally
come
out
with
the
watch
it
be
have
mix
review
but
it
be
the
first
iteration
people
expect
more
look
out
for
a
lot

all

i
sure

a

on
my

when
I
get
out
of
the

after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
in
the
hospital
I
be
give
warfarin
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
about
Eliquis
then
my
doctor
tell
I
eliquis
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
and
pe
blood
clot
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
but
eliqui
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
have
both
know
Eliquis
my
thinking
turn
around
doctor
tell
you
to
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
eliqui
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
a
artificial
heart
valve
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
bruise
more
easily
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
bleed
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
Eliquis
may
increase
you
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
tell
you
doctor
about
all
DVT
PE
blood
clot
ELIQUIS
treat
major
bleeding
plus
have
less
both
make
switching
to
eliqui

for
spotlight
on
this
one
it
tell
the
story
of
a
team
of
reporter
at
the
Boston
Globe
investigate
child
abuse
it
be
a
really
tough
story
to
tell
and
there
be
not
a
lot
of
bell
and
whistle
on
this
one
it
be
not
like
you
have
cgi
and
big
car
chase
it
be
a
strip
down
story
and
tell
it
so
well
all
about
the
story
and
the
acting
if
he
nominal
a
lot
of
people
be
look
at
Leo
DiCaprio
that
be
right
he
be
struggle
for
survival
this
could
be
he
year
let
look
at
the
best
actress
side
of
thing
brie
Larson
be
get
a
lot
of
buzz
for
room
she
be
a
actress
from
the
indy
film
world
and
room
be
about
a
woman
that
be
hold
captive
in
a
room
for
most
of
she
adult
life
end
up
have
a
child
by
she
captor
it
be
all
about
the
casting
and
they
nail
it
I
like
the
golden
globe
because
they
have
best
drama
and
best
comedy
category
what
do
you
think
might
win
in
the
best
comedy
category
we
be
look
at
the
Martian
interesting
that
it
be
nominate
as
a
comedy

do
not
it
make
you
laugh
it
be
about
a
astronaut
that
leave
on
Mars
struggle
for
survival
unless
you
be
that
astronaut
but
the
dialogue
be
really
funny
the
character
Matt
Damon
play
have
a
great
sense
of
humor

think
it
be
tip
to
win
what
be
the
highlight
when
it
come
to
look
at
television
one
of
the
big
highlight
be
robot
that
be
a

capture
critic
attention

be
definitely
lead
the
pack

Jim
SCIUTTO
we
begin
with
break
news
be
it
a
random
act
of
violent
crime
or
a
act
of
terrorism
right
now
a
manhunt
be
under
way
in

for
the
gunman
who
open
fire
outside
of
a
pub
in
Tel
Aviv
quloesed-circuit
video
which
we
will
show
you
right
now
show
he
spray
the
area
with
gunfire
there
he
be
highlight
as
patron

be
kill
four
people
seriously
injured
more
surveillance
video
have
surface
just
now
this
be
from
moment
before
the
shooting
at
a
grocery
store
it
appear
to
show
a
man
pull
out
a
gun
and
as
you
can
see
open
fire
on
the
street
people
run
as
he
do
CNN
do
not
know
who
provide
either
of
these
surveillance
video
first
let
go
to
Ian
Lee
we
reporter
on
the
ground
in
Israel
what
be
the
latest
you
be
hear
there
we
be
watch
these
video
and
really
this
be
what
the
police
be
watch
as
well
look
to
see
what
clue
they
can
get
about
this
gunman
which
direction
he
run
off
to
and
which
will
give
he
a
clue
as
to
where
he
could
possibly
be
go
a
quite
bizarre
footage
that
cctv
video
in
the
supermarket
look
at
produce
pick
it
up
put
it
back
before
put
he
bag
on
those
shop
cart
and
shoot
up
the
pub
the
sidewalk
kill
those
people
then
run
away
but
leave
that
bag
too
that
will
be
another
clue
for
authority
as
they
search
for
he
right
now
but
it
be
shabbat
here
in
Israel
and
security
be
go
to
be
ramp
up
around
Tel
Aviv
not
only
for
look
for
the
suspect
but
also
in
case
this
be
a
terrorist
attack
right
now
they
do
not
know
if
it
be
they
want
to
secure
place
of
worship
as
well
Jim
Ian
Lee
live
from
Jerusalem
I
want
to
talk
to
Mickey
Rosenfeld
national
spokesman
for
israeli
police
he
be
on
the
phone
with
we
right
now
be
there
any
information
right
now
as
to
whether
this
be
a
criminal
or
terrorist
incident
at
this
moment
in
time
they
be
investigate
try
to
determine
whether
it
be
a
terror
attack
or
criminal-related
incident
it
be
not
clear
yet
it
be
not
clear
yet
it
be
due
to
the
fact
we
be
look
at
evidence
and
look
at
CCTV
footage
from
a
number
of
different
angle
different
area
we
main
emphasis
at
the
moment
be
to
continue
search
different
undercover
unit
counterterrorism
unit
in
the
area
of
about
two
mile
of
try
to
find
that
specific
individual
who
flee
the
scene
as
you
look
at
these
two
video
that
have
come
out
of
course
the
first
thing
I
look
at
be
what
kind
of
skill
do
the
shooter
show
and
I
know
it
be
early
and
these
video
just
come
forward
the
way
he
take
that
weapon
do
that
indicate
to
you
training
a
amateur
can
you
tell
anything
from
these
video
at
this
point
obviously
a
lot
can
be
learn
we
be
not
go
to
go
into
the
psychology
and
the
operational
perspective
there
the
importance
of
be
at
this
moment
in
time
just
three
hour
after
the
incident
take
place
we
have
confirm
in
Tel
Aviv
be
we
have
two
Israelis
dead
we
have
three
people
injured
moderately
there
be
suspect
still
on
the
loose
and
therefore
security
operation
be
continue
in
the
Tel
Aviv
area
extra
roadblock
set
up
around
the
Tel
Aviv
area
and
in
the
city
of
Tel
Aviv
take
into
consideration
the
SA
bath
have
already
come
we
be
talk
about
hundred
of
people
that
make
they
way
to
different
synagogue
and
therefore
secure
those
area
we
would
not
want
to
have
a
second
incident
anyplace
in
Tel
Aviv
therefore
the
operation
be
continue
relatively
intensely
final
question
I
understand
there
be
a
magazine
leave
at
the
scene
as
in
a
weapon
magazine
that
might
show
this
be
a
unusual
kind
of
automatic
weapon
to
be
find
in
Israel
any
information
on
that
I
can
not
confirm
that
what
I
can
confirm
be
a
automatic
weapon
be
use
over
15
shot
be
fire
and
spray
a
number
of
different
direction
people
in
the
pub
as
well
as
on
the
sidewalk
a
major
incident
as
far
as
we
be
concern
we
be
watch
right
now
to
find
exactly
who
the
suspect
be
and
to
clearly
confirm
what
the
background
be
of
that
incident
understand
we
know
it
be
early
we
will
continue
to
check
in
with
you
we
appreciate
you
time

where
the
shooting
occur
we
hear
multiple
round
of
gunshot
and
people
pull
over
they
car
this
be
something
I
would
never
see
before
usually
in
the
United
States
but
lept
out
of
they
car
one
man
with
a
handgun
to
pursue
the
individual
who
do
this
so
it
be
a
lot
of
Israelis
and
people
here
in
Tel
Aviv
run
towards
the
scene
as
other
people
get
away
from
it
so
it
be
a
bit
of
a
confusing
scene
when
it
happen
it
must
have
be
remind
I
in
Israel
do
many
people
--
be
many
people
allow
to
carry
weapon
like
that
personal
weapon
that
I
be
not
sure
I
be
not
israeli
I
be
from
New
York
I
be
here
on
vacation
but
my
friend
say
many
people
have
be
train
and
have
military
background
that
they
may
have
a
weapon
with
they
or
train
to
use
it
the
gentleman
I
see
may
have
be
law
enforcement
who
be
off
duty
I
do
speak
to
a
number
of
witness
she
speak
to
channel
2
in
Israel
and
also
to
I
he
describe
how
she
and
seven
other
people
hide
in
a
storage
closet
in
the
basement
of
a
bar
next
year
one
woman
say
she
hear
gunshot
and
immediately
think
of
terrorist
she
realize
it
be
a
shooting
it
be
a
terrifying
scene
but
people
be
raem
really
come
together
on
the
street
afterwards
and
help
each
other
these
scene
have
become
so
familiar
have
not
they
in
Paris
Tel
Aviv
San
Bernardino
tell
we
about
you
own
experience
of
it
my
experience
be
I
be
just
in
a
store
down
the
street
we
have
a
very
chatty
store
owner
and
thank
God
he
talk
to
we
for
a
really
long
time
because
we
be
ready
to
head
up
to
that
part
of
the
street
possibly
to
grab
a
drink
who
know
if
he
have
not
speak
to
we
for
so
long
we
may
have
be
there
tension
be
high
Israelis
I
have
speak
to
be
still
a
bit
on
edge
day
after
a
stab
attack
happen
at
the
Gaffa
gate
in
Jerusalem
so
people
be
on
edge
this
will
continue
to
feed
that
fire
no
question
that
feeling
of
be
on
edge
be
not
confine
to
Israel
by
any
means
Megan
Robertson
thanks
for
give
we
you
eyewitness
account
I
want
to
bring
in
Karen
Greenberg
director
of
center
of
international
communication
at
Fordham
law
look
at
this
open
question
now
as
you
hear
from
israeli
police
about
whether
this
be
criminal
or
a
terrorist
incident
but
as
you
look
at
the
seemingly
a
random
act
of
violence
there
someone
have
a
automatic
weapon
and
they
open
fire
on
a
street
what
do
that
pattern
tell
you
well
I
think
you
question
be
excellent
which
be
where
be
the
line
now
in
today
world
between
the
criminal
and
the
terrorist
terrorism
which
be
normally
associate
with
some
political
agenda
be
also
about
terrorize
civilian
make
civilian
afraid
to
go
out
into
any
kind
of
public
space
that
be
what
you
be
see
in
Tel
Aviv
and
what
you
have
see
around
the
world
in
term
of
threat
and
attack
on
train
station
on
public
ven
use
like
we
see
in
Paris
I
think
the
distinction
be
get
smaller
if
this
fit
that
description
although
this
be
in
Tel
Aviv
as
you
know
in
Israel
where
a
terrorist
narrative
the
islamist
terrorist
narrative
have
its
base
it
be
hard
to
think
of
it
separate
from
its
terrorism
listen
even
if
it
be
not
politically
motivated
terrorism
it
be
a
form
of
terrorism
to
shoot
people
in
a
public
place
exactly
this
have
become
in
effect
the
new
you
know
for
terrorist
group
I
be
not
assign
explanation
to
the
Tel
Aviv
shooting
but
when
you
think
of
San
Bernardino
when
you
think
of
Paris
and
elsewhere
it
be
soft
target
be
it
not
make
people
afraid
to
go
to
public
space
in
Munich
we
have
this
scare
around
train
station
that
be
a
difficult
thing
to
guard
against
be
it
not
in
effect
everything
be
a
soft
target
well
yes
and
no
the
one
thing
law
enforcement
have
be
good
over
this
new
year
be
one
day
in
the
year
when
all
of
the
world
be
involve
as
a
potential
target
one
thing
law
enforcement
have
to
do
be
twish
between
that
which
be
truly
threatening
and
that
which
be
not
you
see
a
variety
of
response
across
the
globe
all
of
which
somewhat
wise
and
use
somewhat
good
judgment
for
example
in
France
in
Paris
where
they
cancel
the
firework
and
yet
thousand
and
thousand
of
people
amass
on
the
champ
which
be
the
most
iconic
place
in
Paris
there
be
a
sense
terrorism
be
something
civilian
be
get
use
to
but
there
be
be
a
lot
of
trust
in
law
enforcement
across
the
globe
that
be
worth
point
out
it
be
a
new
phase
in
term
of
understand
what
terrorism
be
no
question
and
that
be
a
important
showing
I
like
you
get
question
all
the
time
from
friend
and
family
when
I
be
cover
the
attack
in
Paris
I
feel
like
I
get
a
dozen
call
say
should
I
go
there
we
have
plan
to
go
there
I
have
similar
question
about
New
York
this
be
a
difficult
judgment
for
member
of
the
public
right
where
do
I
go
where
do
I
not
go
but
also
in
term
term
of
the
way
public
official
communicate
risk
as
well
I
wonder
if
you
think
they
be
get
it
right
they
be
get
it
more
right
than
in
the
past
look
at
New
York
City
New
York
City
a
target
to
everybody
mind
in
term
of
a
terrorist
terrorist
wannabe
as
Mayor
Bloomberg
once
say
every
terrorist
have
a
map
of
the
New
York
City
subway
in
he
pocket
look
at
how
New
York
City
cops
handle
Times
Square
they
have
a
million
people
there
who
I
be
sure
whose
parent
and
friend
be
say
you
better
be
careful
but
they
trust
in
the
official
to
keep
they
safe
there
be
not
a
lot
of
media-driven
threat
scenario
in
term
of
be
careful
here
be
careful
there
I
think
the
media
part
of
this
as
well
in
finally
turn
away
from
sort
of
fear-mongering
of
the
past
towards
we
be
go
to
handle
this
we
be
go
to
live
with
it
you
should
be
vigilant
cautious
yes
you
should
live
you
life
that
be
what
be
happen
in
real
time
now
no
question
I
speak
to
counterterror
official
all
the
time
no
one
have
tell
I
to
tell
people
not
to
go
somewhere
in
fact
very
much
the
opposite
throughout
the
celebration
Christmas
as
well
they
say
enjoy
yourselve
this
be
we
job
in
effect
to
keep
you
safe
Karen
Greenberg
appreciate
you
take
the
time
happy
new
year
to
you
there
be
new
information
this
morning
in
the
indication
against
Baltimore
police
officer
do
Freddie
Gray
have
a
previous
back
injury
prosecutor
hide
that
information
from
the
defense
we
will
discuss
plus
a
judge
ruling
that
bill
cosby
wife
will
have
to
testify
in
the
sexual
assault
case
against
he
hear
why
they
private
conversation
be
not
privileged
break
right
now
witness
report
that
the
skyscraper
hotel
be
still
on
fire
one
day
after
the
inferno
start
these
be
live
picture
from
Dubai
we
will
have
detail
ahead
if
a
denture
be
to
be
put
under
a
microscope
we
can
see
all
the
bacterium
that
still
exist
POLIDENT
unique
micro
clean
formula
work
in
just
3
minute
kill
%
of
odor
cause
bacterium
for
a
cleaner
fresher
brighter
denture
every
day
I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you
doctor
if
it
be
right
for
you
welcome
back
there
be
new
detail
this
morning
in
the
death
of
Freddie
Gray
in
Baltimore
it
could
undermine
the
prosecution
of
police
officer
charge
in
gray
death
last
April
the
news
gray
suffer
a
spinal
cord
injury
as
you
know
and
later
die
now
police
report
say
gray
may
have
preefl
hurt
he
back
but
prosecutor
keep
that
information
from
defense
attorney
we
Miguel
Marquez
have
the
latest
do
we
know
how
serious
this
previous
back
injury
be
that
be
the
very
big
question
if
it
be
a
injury
at
all
it
be
curious
how
this
come
out
defense
attorney
file
document
say
they
want
access
to
all
of
gray
medical
record
because
on
March
31st
last
year
a
few
week
before
he
be
arrest
a
officer
say
Gray
be
give
they
information
about
a
robbery
and
complain
that
he
have
hurt
he
back
or
that
he
back
hurt
on
April
12th
he
be
arrest
on
April
19th
Gray
die
and
only
on
May
1st
do
that
same
officer
say
with
all
the
press
about
Freddie
gray
he
memory
be
jog
and
he
file
this
unsolicited
report
that
they
remember
he
complain
about
a
bad
back
defense
lawyer
say
this
be
they
a-ha
moment
the
prosecution
do
not
turn
this
over
and
we
should
have
access
to
all
medical
record
the
judge
deny
that
in
the
porter
case
for
instance
we
will
find
out
whether
or
not
he
will
allow
it
in
this
case
DWRCHG
defense
lawyer
have
ask
for
all
of
he
incarceration
record
because
they
hear
some
anonymous
tip
that
Gray
may
have
try
to
harm
himself
while
in
police
lockup
in
Baltimore
central
correction
facility
all
of
that
the
judge
have
to
decide
on
the
state
say
they
should
not
have
anything
it
be
all
irrelevant
even
if
he
do
have
a
bad
back
it
be
he
neck
and
a
blunt
force
trauma
that
kill
Gray
so
none
of
this
should
be
rel
vabevant
we
should
decide
on
this
this
come
Thursday
and
the
trial
of
officer
Goodson
be
set
to
begin
on
the
11th
understand
good
analysis
on
this
thank
you
let
get
some
legal
analysis
with
trial
attorney
so
police
van
driver
Goodson
will
go
on
trial
January
11th
First
of
all
Miguel
raise
a
point
do
it
have
any
effect
on
the
relevance
of
this
the
fact
the
police
officer
write
this
report
after
the
fact
after
he
do
and
after
the
riot
well
it
be
a
curious
bit
of
timing
that
this
only
--
this
this
report
would
have
be
author
after
the
officer
memory
be
jog
and
not
at
a
time
con
contemporaneous
it
open
up
this
other
issue
about
Freddie
be
a
police
informant
that
he
be
provide
information
about
other
robbery
it
do
really
send
we
down
this
other
inquiry
about
what
be
he
relationship
the
whole
problem
when
we
be
talk
about
this
legal
ruling
be
here
we
be
the
judge
be
a
gatekeeper
design
to
make
sure
that
only
relevant
information
get
in
front
of
that
jury
at
this
point
where
the
central
issue
in
the
case
be
how
do
Freddie
Gray
become
injure
fatally
injure
anything
that
tend
to
--
that
be
at
all
relevant
to
that
inquiry
should
be
in
the
hand
of
the
defense
otherwise
you
risk
do
a
trial
twice
it
be
a
ripe
appellate
issue
if
they
do
not
turn
that
info
over
there
be
especially
two
question
here
one
be
what
be
the
actual
relevance
and
weight
of
this
information
for
instance
my
back
hurt
sometimes
do
not
mean
for
instance
I
be
go
to
break
my
neck
on
the
flipside
I
imagine
by
withholding
something
in
a
way
you
make
it
a
bigger
deal
than
it
be
right
what
be
you
view
it
be
actually
a
very
huge
deal
the
defense
should
be
allow
to
see
any
potential
information
that
could
help
they
client
because
in
we
justice
system
the
defense
have
have
--
should
have
rights
to
everything
if
this
young
man
have
any
type
of
back
issue
any
type
of
medical
issue
they
should
be
give
that
information
now
the
judge
can
rule
that
that
information
can
not
be
give
in
front
of
a
jury
can
not
be
present
if
it
appear
that
the
prosecution
be
hide
this
information
or
keep
it
from
the
defense
that
be
a
problem
just
like
what
Darren
just
say
they
do
not
want
to
try
this
case
again
if
there
be
a
conviction
if
they
do
not
give
up
that
information
and
provide
it
to
the
defense
they
be
ask
for
this
case
to
be
retry
because
that
be
clearly
a
case
of
ethical
rule
and
they
should
give
that
information
to
the
defense
whether
use
or
not
that
be
use
in
front
of
the
judge
and
the
judge
decision
we
already
have
a
hung
jury
stand
by
because
we
be
go
to
talk
bill
cosby
in
a
moment
we
be
get
word
that
a
driver

this
moment

to
what

welcome
back
new
this
morning
smoke
still
billow
out
of
the
Dubai
hotel
engulf
in
flame
on
new
year
eve
official
still
try
to
find
out
what
cause
the
massive
blaze
source
tell
CNN
when
curtain
catch
fire
on
one
floor
at
least
16
people
receive
medical
treatment
but
amazingly
no
one
be
seriously
hurt
hear
what
one
person
say
who
be
trap
inside
that
burning
building
I
pray
if
this
be
my
last
chance
then
so
be
it
Glenn
be
a
fire
safety
expert
at
Jon
Jay
College
of
Criminal
Justice
join
we
on
the
phone
it
be
good
to
have
you
here
one
thing
that
strike
we
as
we
watch
this
fire
particularly
as
it
be
under
way
last
night
be
the
idea
and
this
be
early
indication
I
have
speak
to
Dubai
official
they
be
try
to
determine
definitively
what
cause
this
fire
but
early
on
they
say
that
they
believe
it
could
have
be
a
curtain
in
one
of
those
room
light
up
and
then
lead
to
the
rest
of
the
fire
I
look
at
how
quickly
that
fire
spread
on
the
exterior
of
the
building
I
be
no
expert
but
that
seem
surprising
that
that
would
be
the
cause
you
be
a
expert
what
do
you
think
as
you
look
at
this
thanks
for
have
I
Jim
when
we
see
the
initial
fire
yesterday
the
first
thing
that
come
to
mind
particularly
folk
in
fire
service
be
the
exterior
cladding
or
the
surface
of
the
material
on
the
outside
of
the
building
with
that
large
you
know
vine
of
fire
we
see
it
pretty
much
point
to
that
be
at
the
source
of
the
issue
here
as
far
as
why
the
fire
spread
so
quickly
up
the
outside
of
the
building
what
be
we
talk
about
here
we
be
talk
about
something
on
the
surface
of
the
window
outside
actually
not
the
surface
of
the
window
but
the
surface
itself
basically
particularly
in
Dubai
study
be
make
of
many
of
the
building
there
and
they
use
a
system
of
acolumn
numb
with
a
component
of
plastic
basically
that
of
course
be
what
the
fuel
be
yesterday
that
we
see
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
estimate
be
that
70
%
of
the
building
a
few
year
ago
have
a
similar
type
of
aluminum
composite
surface
material
we
do
not
know
if
that
be
exactly
what
be
here
but
everything
point
to
plastic
as
part
of
this
--
again
this
exterior
service
of
be
the
culprit
of
why
the
fire
spread
so
quickly
that
be
interesting
I
know
you
be
not
say
this
definitively
but
that
would
explain
a
lot
of
thing
because
they
say
Dubai
authority
that
the
fire
be
on
the
exterior
of
the
building
not
only
on
the
inside
and
it
really
spread
quickly
like
there
be
something
flammable
on
the
outside
fueling
this
yes
there
be
report
I
see
online
that
people
mention
they
smell
a
lot
of
burning
plastic
which
again
would
be
consistent
with
that
Dubai
have
have
a
few
fire
one
ironically
recently
the
building
call
the
torch
another
--
a
few
year
ago
a
similar
situation
so
it
be
something
the
Dubai
government
have
to
take
a
much
more
aggressive
approach
to
deal
with
particularly
one
that
be
there
if
you
say
70
%
of
the
building
have
similar
cladding
it
be
early
in
the
investigation
that
would
certainly
be
something
to
be
address
Glenn
Corbett
fascinating
information
thank
you
for
come
on
thank
you
Jim
back
to
we
break
news
right
now
right
now
israeli

be
try

figure
out
the
nature
of
a

the
shooter
he
get

a
question
right
now
be
be
this
a
random
act
of
violent
crime
be
it
criminal
or
be
it
a
act
of
terrorism
CNN

the
latest
authority
just
do
not
know
yet
do
they
that
be
right
Jim
that
be
one
of
the
two
really
big
question
right

that
they
be
look
into
be
where
be
this
gunman
who
be
this
gunman
also
be
this
a
terrorist
attack
or
be
this
criminal
and
really
this
investigation
hinge
on
determine
if
it
be
a
terrorist
attack
or
criminal
the
police
will
then
go
about
they
investigation
in
different
direction
but
they
be
look
at
this
amateur
video
of
the
CCTV
video
of
what
happen
you
can
see
before
the
attack
take
place
there
be
a
--
the
gunman
be
in
a
supermarket
look
at
produce
he
gather
some
put
it
back
go
on
and
off
screen
then
eventually
put
he
bag
down
on
some
shopping
cart
at
the
entrance
he
pull
out
the
gun
he
start
shooting
everyone
in
this
pub
on
the
sidewalk
take
off
run
but
he
leave
that
bag
behind
that
be
go
to
be
helpful
for
authority
as
they
investigate
it
try
to
get
any
clue
off
this
bag
to
determine
what
the
cause
--
what
the
motive
behind
this
attack
be
right
now
police
be
tell
resident
in
Tel
Aviv
to
go
about
they
normal
life
to
be
extra
alert
but
really
we
have

look
for

e-mail
be
part
of
thousand
of
page
the
judge
order
the
State
Department
to

remember
this
all
go
back
to
the
fact
that
Clinton
do
government
business
from
a
e-mail
server
keep
in
she
home
that
spark
a
political
firestorm
last
year
and
the
e-mail
that
come
out
yesterday
pp
they
include
275
that
have
be
upgrade
to
classify
now
none
of
those
e-mail
be
classify
when
they
be
send
or
receive
that
be
a
point
Clinton
have
make
repeatedly
on
the
campaign
trail
largely
because
republican
have
attack
Clinton
for
send
these
now
classify
e-mail
from
a
private
server
they
argue
it
endanger
national
security
the
e-mail
release
Thursday
they
provide
a
little
window
into
Clinton
inner
circle
they
make
a
flow
chart
as
to
who
get
to
ride
with
Clinton
in
she
secret
service
suv
in
another
she
ask
aide
to
correct
the
record
after
a
quote
ridiculous
column
report
a
number
of
time
cabinet
member
have
visit
the
White
House
she
say
please
go
through
my
schedule
and
count
my
visit
to
refute
this
you
know
apparently
she
be
concern
that
she
visit
have
be
undercount
in
another
exchange
Clinton
and
the
senior
aide
seem
to
mock
at
American
citizens
stick
in
Egypt
after
the
embassy
close
a
woman
strand
on
the
river
cruise
ship
tell
CNN
the
response
be
grossly
insufficient
Clinton
agreeds
with
the
aide
that
they
send
out
a
good
communication
department
she
add
why
be
be
on
a
cruise
ship
a
dangerous
or
difficult
situation
and
then
there
be
the
e-mail
alert
Clinton
to
that
now
famous
photo
of
she
where
she
be
wear
sunglass
and
check
she
blackberry
aide
tell
she
that
photo
have
start
to
go
viral
Clinton
ask
why
now
that
be
on
the
way
to
Libya
to
which
she
chief
of
staff
simply
say
you
look
cute
Clinton
embrace
that
Hillary
meme
but
they
use
that
photo
to
cast
she
in
a
negative
light
you
have
page
come
out
yesterday
Jim
a
little
glimpse
behind
the
scene
of
what
it
be
like
to
be
secretary
of
state
so
a
lot
of
inside
baseball
stuff
here
quickly
and
I
know
it
be
early
a
lot
to
delve
through
but
anything
politically
damaging
in
these
e-mail
there
be
nothing
hugely
politically
damaging
here
there
be
a
e-mail
from
a
adviser
of
hers
a
long-time
pollster
mark
pen
that
when
president
Obama
get
catch
on
a
live
Mike
talk
to
the
russian
president
say
I
will
have
more
room
to
maneuver
after
the
election
mark
suggest
maybe
you
should
think
about
distance
yourself
from
that
or
get
out
of
that
situation
there
be
some
political
back
and
forth
and
you
get
a
little
behind
the
curtain
of
what
she
--
how
she
be
be
advise
but
nothing
that
be
go
to
be
hugely
politically
damage
we
find
just
yet
thanks
for
look
through
all
of
it
for
we
a
new
year
and
a
new
staff
for
Ben
Carson
three
of
the
republican
presidential
candidate
and
one-time
front-runner
top
adviser
bail
on
he
campaign
yesterday
with
the
first
vote
of
that
election
just
one
month
away
Carson
have
be
struggle
in
the
poll
as
Ted
Cruz
and
Marco
Rubio
have
see
they
fortune
rise
we
have
more
on
the
change
in
the
Carson
camp
and
also
Jennifer
Ruben
with
Washington
post
right
turn
blog
s
Sara
what
be
go
to
be
the
fallout
of
these
campaign
departure
it
be
be
kind
of
interesting
to
see
because
Ben
Carson
forecast
he
be
go
to
have
a
campaign
shakeup
and
then
walk
it
back
these
aide
end
up
leave
anyway
I
do
not
think
we
should
necessarily
be
surprise
to
see
the
departure
in
the
wake
of
Ben
forecasting
this
himself
I
think
this
put
the
campaign
in
rocky
footing
week
from
the
Iowa
Caucus
and
the
challenge
be
go
to
be
can
you
get
past
this
shakeup
and
buckle
down
turn
out
the
ground
game
and
keep
meeting
with
voter
and
try
to
turn
around
the
first
step
that
Ben
Carson
really
be
not
ready
for
prime
time
he
be
not
ready
to
be
president
still
week
until
Iowa
still
possible
you
could
do
that
on
the
ground
right
now
Ben
Carson
poll
number
be
move
in
the
wrong
direction
Jennifer
I
speak
with
Armstrong
Williams
yesterday
close
adviser
of
Ben
Carson
he
be
in
effect
the
guy
on
the
other
side
of
this
intracampaign
battle
the
other
side
of
the
folk
who
decide
to
leave
the
campaign
yesterday
in
that
interview
he
say
Carson
be
the
only
authentic
evangelical
in
the
race
how
do
you
think
the
other
candidate
be
go
to
respond
to
that
claim
well
we
have
Marco
Rubio
and
Ted
Cruz
both
make
a
very
strong
pitch
for
the
evangelical
crowd
let
not
forget
there
be
Mike
Huckabee
and
Rick
Santorum
also
very
popular
with
so-called
value
voter
I
think
he
have
a
special
place
in
the
heart
of
many
of
those
voter
however
I
do
agree
with
that
I
think
he
campaign
be
probably
do
even
before
this
last
episode
he
be
really
be
plummet
in
the
poll
CNN
poll
other
poll
that
be
out
there
I
think
this
just
confirm
that
maybe
the
presidential
race
and
the
whole
process
of
run
for
president
be
not
something
that
be
really
in
he
wheelhouse
Sara
Jennifer
thanks
for
walk
we
through
it
all
appreciate
it
tune
in
at
Eastern
today
we
will
talk
live
with
Ben
Carson
new
campaign
major
at
Eastern
on
CNN
in
Chicago
now
possible
trouble
for
embattled
mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
thousand
of
newly
release
e-mail
by
city
official
show
police
fear
of
the
shooting
of
McDonald
would
become
a
explosive
political
issue
the
e-mail
show
the
city
attempt
to
control
the
official
statement
about
the
shooting
and
express
concern
about
potential
unrest
if
video
become
public
Rosa
Flores
join
we
now
from
Chicago
smoking
gun
in
here
there
be
a
lot
of
charge
that
RAHM
Emanuel
delay
the
release
of
this
video
to
help
he
political
fortune
as
he
run
for
re-election
do
we
see
some
proof
of
that
kind
of
background
play
well
Jim
no
smoking
gun
yet
let
I
give
you
the
background
CNN
request
all
e-mail
receive
and
write
by
the
mayor
regard
the
Laquan
McDonald
case
like
you
mention
we
receive
hundred
of
e-mail
and
thousand
of
page
so
we
be
still
go
through
those
e-mail
we
do
know
that
the
mayor
be
refer
to
in
those
e-mail
as
mre
that
be
how
he
staffer
refer
to
he
in
these
e-mail
to
give
you
the
broad
overview
the
bulk
of
the
communication
here
be
about
the
message
how
to
handle
the
message
a
lot
of
these
e-mail
be
between
staffer
in
the
communication
department
and
the
law
department
try
to
figure
out
what
message
to
put
out
this
be
after
the
shooting
of
the
--
of
Laquan
McDonald
before
the
release
of
the
video
before
and
after
the
indictment
of
the
police
officer
involve
let
talk
about
one
particular
e-mail
just
to
give
you
a
sense
now
here
be
the
timeline
this
be
before
the
Laquan
McDonald
shoot
video
be
release
there
be
a
attorney
who
have
work
with
the
city
and
he
send
this
e-mail
to
one
of
the
mayor
top
staffer
I
be
go
to
quote
here
it
say
I
be
concerned
that
the
city
may
erupt
when
and
if
the
video
get
out
again
this
be
Laquan
McDonald
shooting
video
that
show
Laquan
McDonald
be
shoot
and
kill
by
a
police
officer
I
be
go
to
continue
here
what
if
the
mayor
and
some
community
leader
such
as
father
Pfleger
lead
a
peaceful
demonstration
with
100
plus
african-american
youth
wear
red
mortar
board
to
symbolize
education
as
a
solution
while
also
invoke
the
image
of
Laquan
McDonald
in
a
positive
manner
we
do
know
a
lot
of
protest
do
happen
we
cover
these
protest
for
week
now
here
be
the

I

in
we
criminal
attorney
for
more
clarification
the
requirement
of
really
Camille
Kcosby
to
testify
againt
she
husband
and
this
be
not
in
the
sexual
assault
case
but
the
the
defamation
case
which
be
tie
to
the
same
charge
but
within
the
same
case
and
how
significant
be
that
or
rare
well
it
be
not
rare
at
all
we
be
hand
allot
of
civil
case
and
one
person
that
know
be
the
w
wife
the
wife
know
everything
that
be
go
on
and
under
examination
in
deposition
where
the
wife
have
to
raise
she
right
hand
and
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
they
will
kraung
der
pressure
and
start
to
admit
to
thing
that
possibly
the
husband
do
not
say
one
thing
about
the
deposition
that
be
so
power
ful
on
the
defense
side
be
on
the
plaintiff
side
be
that
get
they
to
make
statement
that
be
not
the
same
if
Bill
Cosby
say
one
thing
and
he
wife
say
another
then
you
have
contradict
statement
which
be
extremely
relevant
in
the
trial
and
extremely
p
powerful
to
reach
be
be
settlement
in
the
case
and
you
can
not
be
require
to
have
a
wife
testify
against
she
husband
in
a
criminal
case
be
that
the
right
that
be
right
under
some
circumstance
and
there
be
a
few
exception
and
on
the
civil
side
it
be
a
business
manager
which
open
up
a
whole
different
can
of
worm
in
this
case
and
she
be
he
business
manager
and
she
be
tell
the
truth
and
go
to
tell
the
lie
and
it
be
go
to
be
come
down
the
that
and
the
COSBYS
be
in
a
lot
of
trouble
on
this
particular
side
of
it
and
he
have
a
decent
chance
of
win
the
criminal
case
but
the
civil
case
he
may
have
some
serious
issue
Darren
I
want
to
ask
you
this
latest
criminal
case
be
base
on
the
deposition
that
be
release
a
number
of
year
ago
in
July
that
he
acknowledge
t
that
he
be
use
drug
to
help
woman
have
sex
with
he
in
effect
I
want
to
play
a
clip
from
some
20
year
ago
of
bill
Cosby
interview
with
Larry
King
where
he
talk
about
use
a
drug
know
as
spanish
fly
at
the
time
and
back
when
he
be
a
young
man
and
let
listen
to
it
and
I
want
to
get
you
reaction
you
know
what
it
be
spanish
fly
be
the
thing
that
all
boy
from
age
11
to
death
we
will
be
search
iing
f
the
spanish
fly
and
the
old
story
be
that
you
put
a
little
drop
and
the
head
of
the
pin
and
put
it
in
and
COCA-COLA
and
it
will
not
make
any
difference
and
the
girl
would
drink
it
and
then
hello
America
and
Darren
I
mean
uncomfortable
to
the
say
the
least
to
see
those
comment
with
the
laugh
and
a
smile
in
a
case
like
this
be
the
past
statement
of
yauzing
be
something
like
this
irrelevant
and
can
they
be
use
say
this
guy
have
be
talk
about
it
for
20
year
and
remember
that
when
we
put
it
in
the
context
of
the
criminal
case
Bill
Cosby
will
not
be
on
trial
for
be
a
scum
bag
or
the
devil
incarnate
or
whatever
people
think
about
he
because
what
the
prosecution
have
to
prove
in
the
criminal
case
be
that
bill
cosby
drug
and
take
advantage
of
a
woman
on
a
particular
date
at
a
particular
time
and
certainly
the
kind
of
statement
they
make
cosby
loog
horrible
and
as
a
pro
ecutor
you
have
o
be
cringe
at
these
statement
be
admit
possibly
a
and
the
ultimate
problem
of
the
criminal
case
be
that
criminal
case
do
not
get
better
with
age
and
that
criminal
case
be
thorough
vet
and
review
by
the
district
attorney
office
a
decade
ago
I
think
that
the
hurdle
that
they
have
and
the
practical
hurdle
be
what
have
now
happen
in
the
intervene
decade
that
make
it
more
or
likely
ta
they
be
go
to
be
ableb
to
successfully
secure
a
prosecution
about
the
event
of
a
particular
night
I
be
not
sure
that
this
sort
of
generalize
smearing
of
the
Cosby
reputation
be
go
to
help
they
if
the
juror
be
focus
on
that
very
narrow
issue
that
be
ultimately
go
to
be
the
challenge
and
Darren
briefly
so
I
understand
this
and
the
viewer
understand
it
from
the
legal
standpoint
if
you
be
use
a
drug
and
you
admit
that
you
be
use
that
drug
to
help
a
woman
have
sex
with
you
be
that
do
that
the
legally
constitute
sexual
assault
listen
this
be
to
be
argue
in
the
case
of
court
and
if
you
be
in
effect
use
something
to
be
take
away
she
ability
to
have
judgment
I
suppose
do
that
meet
that
standard
legally
so
generally
speak
any
word
or
action
of
a
criminal
defendant
be
potentially
admissible
in
what
be
call
the
admission
and
so
statement
that
Cosby
say
can
come
in
and
whether
or
not
that
statement
or
any
statement
be
relevant
to
the
conduct
on
a
particular
night
be
go
to
to
be
the
question
for
the
judge
as
the
gatekeeper
of
the
evidence
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
come
in
and
ultimately
that
be
go
to
be
one
for
the
juror
to
decide
but
general
ly
speak
if
it
be
a
statement
that
cosby
make
it
be
likely
to
come
in
and
it
be
relevant
to
come
in
at
that
trial
and
Eric

Darren

Matt
thanks
2016
politics
start
with
firework
Ben
Carson
campaign
manager
and
a
number
of
top
aide
have
resign
the
shake-up
come
as
the
Carson
campaign
struggle
to
regain
momentum
as
we
get
closer
to
Iowa
caucus
Robert
Dee
be
a
retire
army
general
will
chair
the
Carson
campaign
will
the
fresh
start
for
Carson
work
join
we
to
discuss
all
this
Chris
Kofinis
and
former
communication
direc
also
Brad
Blakeman
former
deputy
assistant
to
president
George
Bush
and
professor
of
public
policy
politics
and
international
affair
at
Georgetown
University
good
to
see
both
of
you
happy
new
year
happy
new
year
Brad
I
will
start
with
you
can
these
change
resuscitate
the
Carson
campaign
no
I
think
the
doctor
be
in
intensive
care
and
patient
be
get
weaker
the
fact
the
matter
Barry
Bennett
be
a
professional
he
have
be
in
campaign
a
long
time
I
know
he
very
well
when
you
fire
you
chief
surgeon
and
bring
in
business
manager
to
dot
operation
or
military
person
that
be
not
the
right
person
you
need
I
think
that
this
close
to
the
key
battleground
primary
state
of
New
Hampshire
which
be
a
first
secret
ballot
and
first
caucus
state
Iowa
it
be
go
to
be
very
hard
to
Carson
rehabilitate
by
that
time
so
what
do
you
think
Chris
can
Carson
shake
the
chaos
that
surround
this
sort
of
upset
in
a
campaign
and
get
back
on
message
and
what
be
that
message
I
think
it
be
extremely
difficult
if
this
be
a
different
type
of
race
with
different
candidate
if
you
do
not
have
a
trump
or
Cruz
that
be
suck
up
the
anti-establishment
energy
that
would
be
one
thing
you
have
something
similar
happen
back
in
2004
when
John
Kerry
be
have
real
difficult
time
he
basically
focus
he
entire
campaign
on
Iowa
and
be
able
to
turn
it
around
I
just
do
not
see
that
if
you
look
at
all
poll
basically
trump
and
Cruz
in
Iowa
Carson
really
only
have
one
pac
he
have
get
to
win
Iowa
yesterday
because
he
be
not
have
any
place
or
any
significant
effect
in
New
Hampshire
so
I
think
he
will
have
a
really
tough
time
the
one
save
grace
I
will
say
he
campaign
may
have
be
--
money
he
fund-raising
number
be
pretty
impressive
he
raise
23
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
let
I
go
to
you
Brad
to
Chris
point
that
be
a
impressive
haul
for
the
fourth
quarter
can
that
can
that
money
keep
Carson
campaign
on
life-support
for
31
more
day
no
the
good
news
in
America
it
do
not
matter
how
much
money
you
have
look
at
Jeb
Bush
campaign
they
have
plenty
of
money
now
they
be
cut
staff
and
they
be
move
people
into
other
place
ask
for
volunteer
it
be
not
how
much
money
you
have
it
be
how
you
spend
it
sure
but
basically
come
down
to
grassroot
operation
and
get
out
the
vote
if
you
do
not
have
boot
on
the
ground
to
motivate
people
and
especially
in
caucus
state
which
be
not
a
secret
ballot
more
like
a
community
get-together
that
require
organization
and
there
be
no
substation
for
that
and
money
be
not
Chris
can
Robert
deace
put
a
ban
aid
on
Carson
campaign
and
get
the
boot
on
the
ground
and
keep
the
organization
in
place
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
it
be
unlikely
I
think
what
you
be
see
be
a
republican
race
that
have
be
pretty
chaotic
to
say
the
least
and
you
basically
see
two
camp
shape
up
anti-establishment
camp
which
Carson
at
one
point
be
lead
be
really
now
all
about
trump
and
Cruz
on
other
side
you
have
the
establishment
wing
which
be
basically
Rubio
and
maybe
Christie
everybody
else
particular
candidate
like
Jeb
Bush
be
kind
of
politically
dead
man
walk
they
just
do
not
have
a
path
go
forward
when
you
be
be
basically
collapse
in
you
number
and
you
be
just
not
have
any
significant
effect
you
be
talk
just
a
few
week
we
will
have
the
first
vote
it
be
just
not
realistic
I
think
at
this
point
that
Carson
turn
it
around
you
guy
be
both
not
give
a
very
good
forecast
for
the
Carson
campaign
so
Brad
what
happen
at
this
point
yes
trump
be
far
in
the
lead
and
Cruz
be
sniff
he
behind
in
the
lead
in
New
Hampshire
at
this
point
in
latest
poll
but
there
be
still
a
lot
of
people
there
in
the
kind
of
undercard
if
you
will
what
about
Carson
supporter
if
he
be
to
get
out
of
the
race
eventually
we
be
not
say
that
he
be
that
be
he
choice
but
if
he
be
to
where
would
he
supporter
go
to
and
who
perhaps
could
they
help
bolster
I
think
they
will
be
blow
to
the
wind
quite
frankly
there
be
a
lot
of
people
attract
to
Carson
because
he
be
a
outsider
2015
may
have
be
the
year
of
the
outsider
but
the
2016
may
be
the
year
of
insider
where
you
see
Marco
Rubio
rise
in
the
poll
and
Ted
Cruz
this
be
really
a
test
of
Donald
Trump
support
will
Carson
support
if
he
falter
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
gravitate
to
he
the
other
question
will
donald
trump
win
even
Iowa
or
New
Hampshire
if
you
do
not
win
those
two
critical
state
then
you
do
not
have
the
momentum
you
do
and
by
trump
own
word
if
you
be
not
win
you
be
lose
Chris
let
I
get
you
reaction
to
that
Brad
be
say
he
be
question
whether
or
not
trump
can
win
Iowa
or
New
Hampshire
let
say
for
conversation
sake
that
scenario
happen
and
trump
lose
he
strong
lead
with
that
in
mind
might
Carson
deace
would
he
consider
try
to
keep
Carson
alive
to
see
if
those
two
scenario
pan
out
in
Iowa
or
in
New
Hampshire
I
mean
possibly
I
mean
the
one
thing
about
money
Brad
right
about
the
fact
that
money
do
not
really
have
significant
impact
as
sometimes
people
think
but
what
it
do
allow
to
do
be
stay
in
the
race
Carson
may
stay
in
this
race
well
into
March
that
bleed
support
from
the
other
if
you
will
anti-establishment
wing
the
problem
that
trump
have
be
I
do
not
know
listen
everyone
have
be
predict
he
political
death
so
many
time
I
be
get
tired
of
it
to
be
honest
it
be
not
worth
it
every
crazy
thing
he
say
would
be
he
political
obituary
but
end
up
not
be
so
I
think
real
question
though
if
he
lose
Iowa
and
I
think
there
be
a
pretty
good
chance
he
will
what
do
it
do
to
he
support
my
guess
it
pop
it
if
it
do
then
he
be
in
real
trouble
because
a
guy
like
--
who
be
in
trouble
Trump
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
lose
Iowa
and
you
lose
New
Hampshire
what
candidacy
do
you
have
consider
the
fact
that
you
be
lead
everywhere
what
end
up
happen
here
be
when
you
lose
those
two
first
two
primary
or
even
lose
one
you
national
number
collapse
we
have
see
this
play
out
and
play
out
to
my
point
Brad
see
if
you
answer
this
and
this
be
the
last
answer
my
point
if
what
Chris
be
say
trump
be
out
of
the
race
that
be
exactly
my
point
do
that
give
Carson
the
possibility
to
move
up
in
the
poll
Brad
not
if
he
do
not
perform
well
in
Iowa
and
New
Hampshire
people
like
to
go
with
winner
collapse
will
be
swift
if
you
be
not
win
of
the
trouble
with
trump
he
set
expectation
so
high
if
he
lose
how
do
you
explain
that
because
of
this
objective
event
people
do
something
it
be
not
subjective
event
where
you
can
spin
it
any
way
you
want
I
think
next
few
week
will
be
very
volatile
in
the
republican
field
a
we
be
go
to
see
exactly
whether
trump
momentum
will
stay
and
whether
Carson
have
the
ability
to
stay
beyond
New
Hampshire
which
be
good
news
for
democrat
you
know
what
you
just
get
the
last
word
in
Chris
Brad

you

firework
light
up
the
sky
of
new

eve
there
in
Dubai
this

take
a
look
here
be
in
a
high-rise

in
a

there
be
word
they

John
my
understanding
they

not
sure
what
start
this
fire
right
you
be
absolutely
right
arthel
it
be
still
under
investigation
but
Dubai
media
office
release
a
press
release
that
be
the
government
representative
agency
not
long
ago
call
it
a
x
so
certainly
the
question
we
be
all
thinking
at
first
when
we
see
this
be
it
terrorism-related
but
at
this
point
they
be
not
say
that
again
call
it
a

but
have
say
that
it
be
still
under

earlier
take
a
look
first
off
we
see
the
picture
come
in

video
come
in
it
be
still
smolder
what
be
call

but
this
lead
to
a
low

this

the

want
to
campaign
to
warn
people
about
the
danger
of

the

the
Clinton

get
new
life
in

the
media
revisit
bill
Clinton
history
with
woman
after
Gop
front
runner
Donald
Trump
declare
it
fair
game
after
Hillary
Clinton
accuse
he
of
sexism
let
bring
in
Judith
Miller
a
Pulitzer
prize-winning
investigative
reporter
and
author
and
Fox
News
contributor
Washington
bureau
chief
for
the
Chicago
Sun
Times
happy
new
year
to
both
of
you
and
thanks
for
be
here
should
the
media
be
cover
this
sort
of
thing
and
if
so
do
it
give
reporter
a
more
legitimate
reason
to
be
challenge
the
clinton
on
the
campaign
trail
and
Donald
Trump
too
all
be
fair
in
love
war
and
politics
we
be
see
a
flare-up
of
these
old
charge
donald
trump
try
to
divert
attention
away
from
issue
that
be
unfavorable
to
he
so
this
be
go
to
happen
but
whether
or
not
the
media
ought
to
focus
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
on
this
be
a
separate
issue
for
Donald
Trump
from
the
republican
standpoint
absolutely
stupid
politics
counterproductive
because
bill
Clinton
remain
accord
to
the
blue
Marion
CNN
poll
one
of
the
most
popular
former
president
in
America
the
intention
of
Hillary
Clinton
be
clearly
that
she
want
to
remind
voter
how
wonderful
the
economy
be
during
she
husband
presidency
and
Donald
trump
have
change
the
equation
and
now
people
be
be
remind
of
oh
yes
we
have
to
suffer
through
a
very
long
impeachment
process
that
be
a
argument
that
if
you
want
to
make
it
be
talk
to
Republicans
he
first
goal
be
to
win
a
republican
primary
presumably
these
be
voter
who
never
be
fan
and
never
will
be
fan
or
supporter
of
bill
or
Hillary
Clinton
by
focus
on
bill
Clinton
right
now
he
do
it
at
potential
risk
of
not
know
if
this
be
go
to
help
he
do
the
hard
work
of
organize
to
get
people
to
the
Iowa
Caucus
and
vote
for
he
in
New
Hampshire
I
be
wait
for
to
a
comedy
sketch
of
Donald
Trump
and
Bill
Clinton
together
privately
exchange
story
about
they
sexual
extra
period
and
infidelity
and
so
on
and
so
forth
be
not
it
true
that
Donald
Trump
be
arguably
a
hypocrite
and
he
will
face
reporter
question
and
may
be
voter
question
about
he
own
infidelity
absolutely
why
would
donald
trump
want
to
open
up
the
sexual
past
of
the
candidate
I
do
not
understand
that
but
as
you
point
out
totally
change
the
conversation
yesterday
the
Wall
Street
Journal
have
a
extraordinary
piece
recap
the
amount
of
money
the
Clinton
Foundation
get
for
24
company
at
time
when
Hillary
Clinton
be
in
a
position
to
act
on
something
at
the
State
Department
even
though
there
be
no
evidence
she
actually
do
anything
to
help
she
husband
or
help
the
company
that
be
pay
this
money
but
these
be
legitimate
issue
that
instead
we
be
talk
about
a
completely
frivolous
issue
be
that
Americans
do
not
care
about
Americans
think
by
and
large
that
somebody
sexual
history
and
sexual
infidelity
be
not
the
most
important
issue
face
they
we
be
talk
about
job
and
the
economy
and
they
own
life
I
wonder
if
trump
need
to
tread
carefully
here
insist
woman
voter
love
I
the
poll
show
otherwise
I
take
a
close
look
at
latest
Fox
news
poll
show
a
substantial
gender
gap
of
15
point
he
be
below
on
woman
15
point
among
he
supporter
primary
and
general
election
you
get
to
be
careful
here
normally
I
would
say
of
course
but
you
know
every
time
you
say
this
be
bad
he
should
not
say
this
this
could
be
bad
for
the
campaign
or
he
do
this
hand
gesture
all
it
do
be
make
he
more
popular
for
now
I
be
not
go
to
predict
if
it
be
good
or
bad
all
this
be
be
he
be
not
lay
the
foundation
so
that
if
he
do
not
win
in
Iowa
or
New
Hampshire
he
have
a
shaky
foundation
to
explain
he
campaign
if
you
want
to
focus
on
how
you
be
do
in
the
pole
so
far
it
have
not
run
out
and
Donald
Trump
be
listen
I
give
you
you
do
on
this
but
a
prudent
person
would
have
some
backup
in
case
it
do
not
work
woman
will
comprise
50
%
come
November
so
this
be
a
relevant
topic
they
be
a
important
voting
bloc

of

have

include
high-profile
murder
case
remember
ody
Arias
the
murder
ex-boyfriend
after
a
sensational
and
crack
trial
the
case
of
a
teacher
who
be
rape
and
murder
by
she
younger
high
school
student
in
Massachusetts
the
the
retrial
of
a
student
at
a
prestigious
prep
school
that
highlight
a
solid
tradition
know
as
the
senior
salute
Kent
Zimmerman
be
national
law
Journal
contributor
and
former
general
counsel
and
criminal
defense
attorney
good
to
see
you
both
let
I
start
with
you
shocking
enough
Jody
Arias
admit
she
shoot
she
boyfriend
in
the
head
and
stab
he
30
time
and
go
on
on
the
witness
stand
you
thought
it
have
sex
and
murder
and
captivate
the
country
attention
for
several
year
the
jury
could
not
decide
how
she
should
be
punish
she
be
convict
shoot
in
the
head
she
admit
to
be
that
the
jury
could
not
decide
what
to
do
with
she
the
most
salacious
detail
come
up
after
the
trial
in
my
view
renewable
out
say
the
jury
foreman
71-year-old
have
a
crush
on
hear
that
develop
during
the
trial
and
that
be
why
he
be
a
holdout
and
do
not
want
to
give
she
life
a
alternate
juror
have
corroborate
that
in
interview
after
on
the
witness
stand
seem
to
go
one
day
after
day
forever
kind
of
like
the
Simpson
trial
that
a
lot
of
people
watch
it
think
be
melodrama
that
make
it
harder
for
the
juror
to
convict
she
and
sentence
she
not
to
convict
she
she
be
convict
but
to
sentence
she
to
death
the
more
you
get
to
know
a
person
and
they
story
even
if
it
be
bizarre
or
unbelievable
its
still
connect
you
with
that
person
and
to
impose
a
highest
punishment
possible
become
much
more
difficult
it
be
clever
to
keep
she
on
the
witness
stand
as
long
as
possible
I
do
not
know
how
much
be
strategy
or
just
take
hear
time
but
I
would
say
this
be
a
incredible
waste
of
resource
for
the
people
of
Arizona
to
go
through
two
death
penalty
trial
and
million
of
dollar
and
for
what
what
do
they
end
up
with
Lake
in
prison
it
go
on
forever
go
to
fill
but
Chisholm
a
shocking
case
the
defense
admit
that
this
14-year-old
go
into
the
bathroom
rape
and
kill
he
high
school
teacher
just
awful
and
the
surveillance
video
they
have
to
admit
it
but
he
claim
insanity
schizophrenia
that
be
the
claim
and
they
have
a
expert
testify
he
have
early
onset
absolutely
not
the
prosecution
say
this
be
premeditate
they
bring
evidence
to
light
that
show
he
bring
the
murder
weapon
to
school
ahead
of
time
bring
a
change
of
clothes
could
change
out
of
they
which
he
allegedly
do
the
prosecution
prevail
with
most
interesting
about
this
case
many
people
believe
that
he
be
convict
he
should
go
away
for
a
long
time
maybe
forever
because
of
he
age
due
to
a
Supreme
Court
opinion
and
Massachusetts
Supreme
Court
opinion
he
could
get
out
in
15
to
25
year
that
have
be
since
a
lot
of
people
there
be
a
picture
of
he
let
I
move
forward
to
the
next
case
the
PREP
school
trial
in
the
end
this
young
perhaps
school
student
who
be
accuse
of
sexual
assault
rape
essentially
the
most
serious
charge
be
acquit
in
this
end
he
be
convict
of
some
of
the
lesser
charge
but
I
think
why
people
be
interested
in
this
senior
so
be
a
tradition
at
this
prep
school
for
privileged
kid
talk
to
we
about
this
it
show
the
elite
kid
who
have
every
opportunity
in
the
world
to
take
on
such
a
disgusting
tradition
of
the
senior
salute
what
I
find
interesting
in
this
case
be
a
compromise
verdict
by
the
juror
in
my
opinion
because
you
--
they
acquit
he
of
the
most
serious
charge
but
convict
he
of
one
of
the
charge
which
be
a
felony
which
blend
into
the
sex
offender
registry
and
treat
he
as
a
convict
felon
so
it
be
kind
of
a
compromise
the
fact
finder
do
not
complete
the
believe
the
victim
in
this
case
but
still
impose
punishment
of
a
felony
to
show
basically
as
a
deterrent
for
someone
else
to
do
this
hopefully
that
tradition
have
now
really
be
put
away
teenager
will
continue
to
exhibit
bad
judgment
and
it
be
up
to
the
adult
around
they
to
help
guide
they
the
accusation
the
school
know
and
turn
a
blind
eye
try
to
have
sex
with
girl
maybe
some
of
its
on

be
the

nine
story
from
scaffolding
at
the
four
season
hotel
he
and
a
friend
have
get
on
to
the
roof
from
a
upper
floor
they
be
try
to
shoot
a
photograph
when
they
climb
back
down
and
the
man
fall
the
four
season
extend
condolence
to
the
victim
family
he
friend
be
not
hurt
neither
man
be
stay
at
the
hotel
do
you
use
word
like
problematic
or
VAIP
well
one
university
want
you
to
stop
they
have
put
they
on
the
annual
list
of
vanish
word
the
creator
want
to
get
rid
of
these
word
because
they
be
misuse
or
overuse
like
break
the
internet
man
spreading
we
know
some
people
who
have
make
that
famous
and
one
of
the
biggest
offender
of
the
year
so
you
know
a
lot
of
we
would
use
this
to
start
a
sentence
which
would
be
such
a
no-no
the
creative
Star
Wars
throw
a
wet
blanket
on
all
the
love
for
the
latest
movie
by
compare
Disney
to
slave
owner
what
be
this
about
money
expert
Jen
Westhoven
be
here
he
be
apologize
but
Disney
can
not
be
happy
about
this
so
--
so
here
we
go
so
George
Lucas
the
storied
founder
say
that
when
he
sell
the
rights
to
star
war
to
Disney
it
be
like
sell
he
child
to
white
slaver
awkward
some
people
call
this
the
attack
of
the
moan
Lucas
also
say
that
Disney
be
not
keen
to
have
he
around
all
of
this
be
tape
before
the
movie
premiere
to
huge
success
fastest
film
to
hit
$
1
billion
at
the
box
office
I
mean
giant
smash
business
success
here
so
you
can
only
imagine
how
Disney
react
behind
closed
door
Lucas
later
say
it
be
inappropriate
he
respect
Disney
and
he
also
say
in
a
way
Lynn
well
just
listen
for
the
humanity
he
say
leave
Star
Wars
be
like
a
breakup
or
a
divorce
messy
and
very
very
hard
to
do
so
in
a
way
I
could
see
why
he
would
have
conflict
feeling
and
might
make
a
mistake
all
right
the
phone
carrier
be
go
to
stop
offer
two-year
contract
in
2016
they
be
the
last
major
phone
company
to
do
so
but
reportedly
start
next
year
you
be
go
to
have
to
pay
the
full
price
up-front
if
you
want
a
new
phone
or
pay
it
off
in
installment
back
to
you
thank
you
so
much
Jen
well
president
Obama
be
on
vacation
and
a
lot
of
people
read
on
vacation
he
be
no
exception
16
day
in
Iowa
the
White
House
say
he
bring
lot
of
book
with
he
to
keep
he
occupy
all
but
the
Wright
brothers
be
fiction
when
you
add
they
all
up
page
that
be
100
page
a
day
for
the
president
to
read
but
they
have
be
there
for
a
while
since
December
19th
so
he
be
get
some
time
on
he
hand
new
year
celebration
across
the
country
do
go
off
without
a
hitch
but
a
man
who
be
loyal
to
Isis
be
stop
before
he
could
carry
out
a
attack
on
people
ring
in
2016
we
will
tell
you
what
we
know
I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you
doctor
if
it
be
right
for
you
be
you
live
with
slow
internet

last
13

we
have
take
a
little
pause
in
this

to
feel
gratitude
for
the
life
and
the

we

it
be
a
great
sentiment
we

a
incredible

John
of
spread
the
message
of

of
organ
donation
the

have
increase
tenfold
since

this
be
decorate

medallion
make

grind
there
be
a

so
many

20
and
30

40
life
absolutely
absolutely
and
the
importance
of
be
a
organ
donor
can
not
be
understate
in
the
world
of
medicine
there
be
so
much
research
be
do
in
transplantation
and
there
be
a
relative
ease
of
how
to
give
and
also
for
the
donor
also
good
for
the
donor
and
the
recipient
and
I
think
that
--
when
you
have
certain
genetic
matching
the
technology
now
be
pretty
outstanding
as
many
as
60
people
can
be
help
by
a
single
donor
you
see
those
walk
beside
the
float
they
be
live
donor
as
well
and
it
just
show
that
life
can
go
on
you
adventure
can
go

do
not
be
afraid

happy

big

expect
across
the
country
this
weekend
but
two-third
of
movie
goer
be
also
expect
to
skip
the
snack
line
that
be
why
theater
be
expa
expand
menu
offer
healthier
choice
and
make
every
effort
to
change
perception
about
the
concession
stand
popcorn
whether
plain
salt
or
heavily
butter
have
always
be
addictive
but
the
finger
food
that
never
seem
to
last
through
a
movie
be
not
always
part
of
it
actually
vendor
outside
the
movie
theater
be
sell
snack
to
people
before
they
come
in
Funny
so
the
theater
owner
say
well
okay
we
do
not
need
people
outside
we
door
sell
this
to
we
customer
and
bring
it
in
we
will
sell
it
within
the
theater
itself
so
this
have
be
here
since
the
theater
open
Amber
represent
showcase
cinema
a
movie
chain
that
share
its
parent
company
with
CBS
here
the
lobby
have
a
mini
food
court
feature
hot
dog
pizza
ice
cream
and
starbucks
come
to
the
movie
be
so
a
experience
so
the
food
aspect
be
still
a
really
important
part
of
that
experience
let
all
go
to
the
lobby
to
get
ourselves
a
treat
sale
of
snack
account
for
up
to
40
%
of
a
movie
theater
revenue
but
new
FDA
regulation
to
reveal
calorie
in
those
classic
concession
may
leave
audience
wonder
whether
it
be
worth
it
small
popcorn
weigh
in
at
more
than
calorie
I
think
it
definitely
make
you
stop
and
think
it
have
entrepreneur
like
Ron
Law
think
too
he
eda-movie
be
a
tenth
of
a
bag
of
popcorn
but
he
would
rather
not
call
it
healthy
it
need
to
convey
this
be
good
for
you
subliminally
but
that
it
be
a
fun
food
to
eat
theater
owner
seem
to
agree
the
shelf
at
showcase
cinema
be
stock
with
option
like
nut
and
rice
cracker
so
far
healthy
have
not
be
a
hit
the
movie
theater
for
sure
be
a
place
where
people
you
know
may
want
to
treat
themselves
yeah
they
can
hide
you
should
--
under
the
darkness
of
the
theater
exactly
of
course
people
when
they
go
to
the
theater
it
be
a
special
occasion
a
special
event
I
think
the
concession
go
along
with
that
that
FDA
order
to
post
calorie
be
suppose
to
go
into
effect
today
but
the
deadline
be
postpone
one
more
year
so
there
be
no
reason
to
stop
indulge
over
this
holiday
weekend
Nora

hello

I
be
Jim
Sciutto
in
for
Ashleigh
Banfield
a
very
happy
new
year
to
you
and
welcome
to
legal
view
it
be
in
Tel
Aviv
and
the
night
have
since
fall
but
police
be
on
the
manhunt
for
two
people
who
go
to
a
pub
and
kill
two
police
surveillance
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
shooter
as
the
attack
be
under
way
we
be
not
shure
how
it
be
obtain
but
watch
closely
because
it
be
disturbing
you
can
see
on
the
right-hand
corner
you
can
see
highlight
there
on
the
street
alarming
to
watch
Ian
can
you
tell
we
whether
this
be
a
criminal
act
or
act
of
terrorism
that
be
right
Jim
who
be
this
person
and
where
where
be
he
right
now
and
also
be
this
a
criminal
act
or
be
it
a
act
of
terrorism
depend
on
which
it
be
that
be
go
to
be
lead
the
investigation
into
different
direction
and
we
see
that
video
this
man
a
very
callously
go
into
the
supermarket
and
then
he
put
he
bag
down
on
some
shopping
cart
after
look
at
some
produce
and
that
be
when
he
pull
out
the
gun
and
shoot
these
people
and
kill
two
and
injure
eight
four
of
the
people
be
in
serious
condition
and
the
israeli
police
be
tell
we
that
they
have
no
spell
jens
lead
up
to
this
incident
that
something
like
this
be
go
to
be
take
place
and
right
now
they
be
search
all
of
Tel
Aviv
look
for
the
s
suspect
but
they
be
tell
the
resident
there
to
go
about
the
daily
life
it
be
shabbat
right
now
s
and
people
be
go
to
the
synagogue
and
they
be
say
be
alert
and
people
be
go
door-to-door
and
house-to-house
and
look
for
the
gunman
and
we
be
show
Ian
as
you
have
be
show
the
second
piece
of
the
video
of
the
gunman
and
what
appear
to
be
the
Gupman
in
a
grocery
store
just
before
the
shooting
start
the
manhunt
be
under
way
and
I
be
curious
be
Tel
Aviv
a
city
with
a
lot
of
the
security
camera
out
there
and
New
York
be
cover
with
they
that
will
help
police
to
track
where
the
gunman
go
after
the
shooting
yes
iz
be
reel
be
a
country
cover
in
this
security
camera
and
not
just
in
the
Tel
Aviv
but
here
in
Jerusalem
and
when
you
have
incident
like
this
you
will
get
a
lot
of
the
footage
that
come
out
so
far
we
have
these
two
video
clip
but
the
police
will
be
look
at
the
video
that
have
not
be
release
to
the
public
and
look
into
the
drirection
of
where
where
this
suspect
and
where
where
this
gunman
go
and
other
thing
that
be
go
to
be
help
they
as
well
be
that
he
leave
he
bag
there
be
a
clip
for
the
gun
that
be
leave
behind
and
that
be
be
report
and
so
these
be
the
little
clue
that
will
help
the
police
and
we
be
expect
to
see
more
cctv
footage
as
it
come
to
light
of
this
suspect
and
we
have
a
fairly
clear
shot
of
he
face
as
well
from
the
security
footage
all
thing
be
go
to
help
the
police
in
this
investigation
Jim
and
we
speak
to
israeli
police
before
and
they
say
that
one
concern
be
that
they
need
to
catch
he
because
of
the
possibility
of
a
secondary
attack
Ian
Lee
in
Jerusalem
we
be
get
word
from
southeastern
France
that
soldier
have
open
fire
on
a
car
drive
into
they
C
NSHG
CNN
be
tell
that
one
man
be
hit
and
he
be
expect
to
survive
and
gunman
be
now
capture
but
he
be
injure
and
we
will
get
you
more
information
on
this
attack
as
it
come
into
CNN
and
we
will
learn
more
about
the
train
threat
that
prompt
Munich
Germany
to
close
two
train
station
on
new
year
eve
they
have
specific
information
and
name
not
only
the
station
burk
a
time
frame
midnight
and
a
number
and
nationality
of
the
possibility
attacker
and
include
name
of
they
and
five
syrian
and
iraqi
national
but
so
far
no
lead
have
be
check
out
and
no
one
be
detain
as
they
be
search
desperately
for
these
potential
attacker
around
and
the
station
do
reopen
at
local
time
they
say
that
the
information
come
from
the
and
the
french
authority
but
the
Germans
will
not
confirm
that
they
say
they
have
no
specific
attack
today
and
in
Kabul
Afghanistan
a
12-year-old
boy
be
kill
in
a
suicide
bombing
in
a
restaurant
and
11
people
be
say
to
be
hurt
in
a
french
establishment
popular
with
the
ex-pat
there
the
Taliban
be
claim
responsibility
say
that
the
restaurant
be
own
by
so-called
invader
here
in
the
a
upstate
man
plot
to
kill
party
thegothe
p
partygoer
to
impress
isis
and
instead
he
spend
the
night
in
j
jail
and
could
face
20
year
in
prison
and
so
what
exactly
do
we
know
about
this
man
that
be
allegely
plan
to
do
and
how
do
the
authority
catch
he
in
the
end
well
es
essentially
he
be
plan
to
use
a
pressure
cooker
bomb
implant
at
a
restaurant
and
fortunately
with
the
help
of
a
informant
authority
catch
he
before
he
could
execute
the
plan
a
home
grow
terror
plot
thwart
by
the
FEDS
24-year-old
Nathaniel
Lechman
charge
with
provide
materiel
support
to
Isis
he
plan
be
to
attack
a
restaurant
and
bar
while
partier
be
in
downtown
New
York
and
it
be
a
little
scary
and
I
think
well
you
know
we
have
very
good
security
staff
and
great
police
presence
on
the
East
Avenue
and
they
be
really
try
to
put
the
fear
into
we
and
we
will
not
let
that
happen
talk
to
the
FBI
informant
he
allegedly
discuss
use
a
pressure
cooker
bomb
and
kidnapping
people
and
he
tell
the
informant
I
will
take
a
life
and
I
do
not
have
a
problem
with
that
the
fed
say
that
on
Tuesday
he
go
to
the
area
Walmart
with
the
informant
to
stock
up
for
the
attack
he
buy
black
ski
mask
and
zip
tie
and
knife
and
machete
and
latex
glove
he
plan
to
release
the
individeo
after
the
attack
there
be
also
a
new
normal
when
it
come
to
terrorism
New
York
Andrew
Cuomo
talk
about
the
path
to
radicalization
he
serve
time
in
Attica
and
become
a
muslim
and
go
out
and
become
radical
ize
on
the
internet
and
become
the
proponent
of
one
of
these
terrorist
group
the
isil
group
and
pledge
allegiance
to
the
ISIL
group
and
he
have
a
specific
plan
to
assassinate
people
and
luchman
neighbor
say
that
be
not
the
man
they
know
he
be
a
street
kid
he
be
not
hard
core
terrorist
he
be
just
jump
on
the
bandwagon
and
be
a
little
stupid
and
if
convict
he
could
face
up
to
20
year
in
prison
and
quarter
million
fine
and
now
as
you
say
Jim
it
a
appear
that
he
be
try
to
impress
someone
abroad
who
be
claim
to
be
a
part
of
Isis
and
he
say
that
he
want
to
go
to
Syria
to
prove
himself
to
the
brother
in
Isis
and
he
word
a
instead
they
tell
he
that
he
would
be
much
more
valuable
here
in
the
United
States
try
to
kill
as
many
Americans
as
possible
Jim
that
be
kconsistent
guidance
from
the
Isis
try
to
encourage
the
lone
wolf
around
the
world
thank
you
Boris
Sanchez
from
New
York
and
I
want
to
talk
about
this
more
with
we
guest
if
I
could
begin
with
you
Jonathan
you
be
look
at
a
case
like
this
and
this
be
the
or
really
one
of
the
and
in
Paris
a
coordinate
attack
and
move
back
and
forth
from
Syria
to
Iraq
and
you
have
have
other
attacker
San
Bernardino
among
they
and
you
be
encourage
by
Isis
to
do
something
where
you
be
and
those
be
the
attack
that
be
the
most
difficult
to
identify
in
advance
and
prevent
they
r
and
those
be
the
one
that
we
have
be
fear
for
the
long
of
develop
to
where
they
start
to
realize
you
know
Al
Qaeda
in
the
past
want
to
do
big
attack
that
cause
massive
world
change
in
ideology
but
what
these
isis
and
group
have
have
discover
that
you
do
not
need
the
big
attack
to
cause
fear
because
they
have
learn
how
the
master
the
internet
and
media
basically
so
when
they
can
go
out
to
do
something
as
simple
as
a
machete
attack
they
can
cause
fear
by
go
out
to
use
the
internet
and
the
media
to
force
they
to
get
the
finger
out
and
very
hard
to
identify
before
the
fact
and
general
kimmett
there
be
a
debate
that
you
hear
from
the
president
in
time
that
in
effect
the
threat
from
terrorism
be
in
some
degree
exaggerate
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
be
not
existential
threat
but
these
thing
be
scary
dangerous
and
deadly
but
in
the
scheme
of
thing
they
be
relatively
small
I
mean
you
know
that
line
of
argument
do
you
think
that
the
authority
be
get
the
right
balance
in
term
of
how
they
respond
to
these
kind
of
thing
well
in
some
way
I
do
but
in
most
way
I
do
not
look
no
doubt
that
al
Qaeda
for
year
and
year
have
be
try
to
get
they
hand
on
the
nuclear
materiel
to
either
create
a
dirty
bomb
or
something
worse
we
can
not
downplay
the
threat
by
either
al
Qaeda
or
Isis
and
whether
they
be
by
the
direct
after
fill
yates
working
inside
of
the
country
or
around
the
region
or
as
be
mention
earlier
those
inspire
in
we
country
by
the
Al
Qaeda
or
the
Isis
ideology
understand
general
Kim
mmit
and
it
be
a
very
difficult
balance
and
now
there
be
a
backlash
of
the
shooting
in
Baltimore
of
Laquan
McDonald

there

until
January
2018
know
better
sleep
with
sleep
number
document
today
be
e
e
throwinw
light
on
the
death
of
Freddie
Gray
the
Baltimore
man
die
in
custody
last
April
lead
to
charge
against
six
officer
accuse
of
cause
spinal
injury
that
kill
he
and
now
the
defense
team
say
there
be
maybe
more
in
he
medical
history
that
have
not
be
hear
yet
Miguel
Marquez
be
here
and
also
legal
analyst
Joey
Jackson
and
Danny
Cevallos
and
explain
to
we
Miguel
what
these
unsealed
document
say
about
the
condition
before
that
these
be
document
file
by
the
defense
attorney
see
over
a
officer
and
the
defense
be
claim
that
a
piece
of
the
evidence
be
not
hand
over
to
they
by
the
prosecutor
that
a
police
detective
be
tell
by
gray
on
March
31st
a
couple
of
week
before
he
be
arrest
and
critically
injure
that
he
have
a
bad
back
this
be
in
conjunction
with
gray
provide
police
information
which
be
also
a
new
tidbit
that
we
be
hear
in
another
document
that
the
defense
say
that
Gray
have
injure
himself
or
there
be
a
tip
that
gray
have
injure
himself
while
he
be
incarcerate
and
the
lawyer
w
want
that
and
the
prosecution
say
that
you
should
not
have
any
of
that
because
it
be
not
relevant
to
the
case
because
whether
he
have
a
sore
back
or
bad
back
or
whatever
it
be
it
be
a
broken
neck
in
the
back
of
the
police
van
and
none
of
this
isgoing
to
be
relevant
we
expect
the
judge
to
rule
on
this
this
week
thank
you
Miguel
and
Danny
and
Joey
I
want
to
talk
to
you
two
guy
who
know
the
law
here
and
two
issue
be
it
relevant
that
the
guy
have
some
back
pain
and
we
have
all
have
some
back
pain
I
imagine
before
have
a
serious
and
what
turn
out
to
be
a
deadly
spinal
injury
and
also
how
much
of
this
be
important
that
it
be
not
reveal
to
the
defense
before
and
Danny
and
then
I
will
will
give
you
a
chance
Joey
well
it
be
significant
because
the
prosecution
have
to
disclose
exculpatory
evidence
and
the
dispute
that
arise
be
that
on
the
one
side
the
prosecution
say
this
information
be
not
culpatory
and
the
defense
say
well
we
should
have
be
the
judge
of
that
and
we
should
have
be
the
one
that
decide
whether
or
not
it
be
in
fact
exculpatory
evidence
and
it
should
have
be
turn
over
this
be
a
very
very
common
dispute
and
it
be
evidence
that
each
side
will
look
at
in
drastically
different
way
the
the
prosecution
be
go
to
say
as
we
be
say
here
in
the
segment
that
many
people
have
back
pain
and
this
particular
back
pain
be
not
relevant
to
the
injury
that
he
suffer
on
that
day
but
the
defense
be
go
to
look
at
it
differently
and
look
at
the
medical
science
with
that
evidence
to
demonstrate
to
the
jury
that
in
fact
these
injury
be
significant
and
may
have
be
a
factor
in
the
injury
that
he
suffer
on
that
I
day
but
in
the
case
of
what
we
call
the
Brady
violation
each
side
always
take
a
very
opposite
view
the
prosecution
say
it
be
not
exkuculpatory
and
the
defense
customarily
say
we
should
have
have
it
and
of
course
and
Joey
you
know
we
have
a
mistrial
already
in
this
case
in
the
first
policeman
to
be
charge
police
officer
to
be
charge
in
Freddie
Gray
death
and
you
look
at
this
and
the
defense
say
it
be
hide
somehow
and
do
that
begin
to
get
you
worry
that
you
can
not
go
down
that
path
I
imagine
dismiss
the
case
or
have
to
retry
it
be
there
enough
trouble
do
you
think
to
spell
trouble
down
the
road
not
yet
J
Jim
here
why
what
happen
be
that
the
judge
will
evaluate
the
information
that
defense
have
or
may
not
have
inasmuch
as
do
it
prejudice
the
defense
if
the
case
have
not
start
yet
and
the
defense
have
a
opportunity
to
review
and
evaluate
the
information
they
can
hardly
claim
to
be
prejudice
but
look
at
the
information
that
we
be
talk
about
GOODSON
trial
be
to
start
January
11th
for
depraved
murder
and
the
prosecution
say
that
be
it
a
rough
ride
or
drive
in
spite
that
Freddie
Gray
would
be
dead
well
the
defense
attorney
be
say
that
we
want
information
here
that
a
he
may
have
have
a
pre-existing
back
injury
and
therefore
it
would
have
be
more
likely
that
potentially
this
be
self-inflicted
why
because
the
other
argument
Jim
be
that
he
be
bounce
around
and
there
be
apparently
a
witness
that
establish
accord
to
the
defense
that
he
be
knock
himself
around
in
the
back
of
the
van
and
he
do
it
himself
and
then
of
course
the
defense
want
foir
informan
a
previous
occasion
where
there
be
a
claim
that
Freddie
Gray
on
another
occasion
be
attempt
to
harm
himself
and
so
as
long
as
the
defense
have
this
information
prior
to
trial
and
prepare
to
litigate
it
during
the
trial
it
be
not
go
to
the
represent
prejudice
and
it
will
not
matter
for
the
trial
and
thank
you
Miguel
Joey
and
Danny
and
happy
new
year
to
you
all
thank
you
Jim
and
now
a
day
after
the
massive
fire
we
will
show
you
picture
from
inside
of
the
building
and
plus
I
a
I
will
talk
to
th
woman
who
live
across
the
street
and
she
can
talk
about
the
smoke
and
the
smell
in
that
city
as
the
fire
still
smolder
and
plus
the
most
devastating
flood
the
world
have
ever
see
and
so
they
be
struggle
to
get
the
head
above
water
and
he
be
go
to
join
I
live
right
after
this
break
ally
love
it
I
be
on
the
move
all
day
long
be
it
be
not
without
its
perk
like
see
we
album
sale
go
through
the
roof
enough
to
finally
start
pay
MEG
little
brother
-
I
mean
we
new
tour
manager-with
real
actual
money
we
run
on
how
we
own
it
there
be
almost
exactly
24
hour
in
the
luxury
hotel
in
Dubai
that
erupt
in
flame
and
what
be
leave
of
the
building
be
still
smoking
and
smolder
right
now
and
a
source
tell
CNN
that
a
set
of
curtain
in
the
20th
floor
residence
catch
fire
could
have
be
the
cause
as
new
year
eve
celebration
be
kick
canning
off
in
the
and
the
16
people
do
need
medical
attention
but
we
be
get
a
look
inside
of
the
burn
out
hotel
we
will
show
you
the
picture
right
now
those
be
the
firefighter
leave
there
and
on
the
phone
be
the
former
commissioner
of
the
New
York
Fire
Department
Thomas
Van
Essen
and
Diana
Loesh
and
if
I
could
begin
with
you
Diana
what
be
you
see
now
from
the
building
because
the
word
be
from
the
Dubai
government
be
that
the
fire
be
contain
and
under
control
and
everything
be
finish
in
effect
yeah
right
when
I
look
out
of
my
window
from
my
vantage
point
it
be
still
a
lot
of
the
smolder
and
a
lot
of
smoke
I
be
face
north
and
of
course
the
Burge
Khalifa
Lee
--
Burj
ka
be
still
smolder
ing
and
a
lot
f
crackle
and
sort
of
the
smell
and
this
type
of
thing
so
there
be
a
little
bit
of
the
anticipation
like
more
debris
would
come
down
and
perhaps
the
building
be
something
else
would
happen
fortunately
nothing
else
do
but
a
lot
of
the
smolder
and
the
firefighter
be
do
a
great
job
to
contain
everything
else
that
may
happen
all
right
we
will
keep
you
hope
for
you
safety
and
now
in
the
last
hour
there
be
concern
about
a
external
building
Ma
h
TEERL
in
Dubai
building
that
have
a
plastic
content
and
from
he
view
and
this
be
from
afar
that
could
have
contribute
ed
to
the
rapid
fire
on
the
exterior
a
do
it
sound
like
a
reasonable
explanation
to
you
well
it
sound
like
a
reasonable
cause
for
that
much
fire
on
the
outside
of
the
building
but
what
be
not
reasonable
be
how
one
curtain
in
one
residence
could
create
that
much
fire
to
ignite
the
side
of
a
building
that
be
aluminum-clad
you
know
resin
and
you
would
think
that
it
be
a
good
product
for
insulation
and
for
you
know
create
some
design
to
the
building
that
we
do
not
have
the
material
that
be
so
expensive
and
for
that
fire
go
up
30
40
floor
it
be
impossible
for
the
firefighter
to
put
out
and
when
it
be
burn
for
a
long
time
get
into
the
building
and
melt
the
window
and
make
the
window
crack
and
the
fire
be
inside
and
now
you
have
to
have
the
sprinkler
system
to
be
overwork
for
all
of
those
particular
fire
throughout
500
room
if
that
be
the
case
it
be
a
real
problem
and
if
it
be
in
that
many
building
in
Dubai
I
would
think
it
be
a
real
concern
but
I
do
not
know
if
that
be
the
case
and
to
be
clear
to
the
viewer
we
do
not
know
either
I
have
speak
to
the
Dubai
official
and
they
be
still
determine
the
cause
of
this
but
early
on
they
say
it
be
from
the
curtain
and
now
it
start
on
the
exterior
of
the
building
and
Diana
if
you
be
still
there
with
we
and
as
you
be
watch
this
fire
last
night
can
you
tell
we
how
quick
areally
it
have
spread
well
it
be
spread
quickly
and
it
be
actually
my
son
be
the
one
who
alert
we
to
it
within
five
minute
it
go
from
the
start
up
the
floor
and
within
minute
it
be
engulf
in
flame
and
five
minute
for
the
building
that
side
it
feel
like
five
minute
and
it
be
be
very
quick
and
rapid
and
commissioner
one
thing
that
surprise
a
lot
of
we
here
and
I
imagine
some
of
the
viewer
at
home
be
that
Dubai
go
ahead
last
night
with
this
massive
new
year
eve
firework
show
minute
after
this
fire
be
--
well
as
the
fire
be
still
engulf
the
building
would
you
have
do
the
same
thing
let
people
and
remain
fairly
close
to
the
burning
building
as
they
be
watch
and
we
be
talk
about
thousand
of
people
as
they
be
watch
wae
the
--
they
be
watch
the
fire
firework
show
it
be
hard
to
tell
whether
they
be
in
what
area
where
the
debris
be
on
top
of
they
it
look
fortunate
to
have
the
people
from
civil
defense
and
military
and
wherever
in
place
for
the
spectacular
firework
display
and
they
be
in
place
and
able
to
control
I
guess
the
amount
of
the
people
that
be
go
to
and
from
it
because
anyone
who
be
near
the
fire
actually
would
be
run
towards
the
safety
if
they
be
run
towards
the
firework
display
in
the
other
direction
it
be
hard
to
tell
from
the
video
that
I
have
see
and
now
we
can
look
back
at
it
and
say
they
be
lucky
they
make
the
decision
and
it
work
out
I
do
not
know
what
we
would
have
do
certainly
it
be
a
big
city
it
be
a
very
proud
city
it
be
a
symbol
for
the
progress
of
the
whole
area
and
million
of
people
watch
and
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
watch
and
come
there
to
see
the
display
in
person
it
be
a
big
deal
and
I
can
understand
the
concern
and
the
desire
to
go
forward
wit
they
have
prepare
for
it
and
for
a
whole
year
and
lot
of
money
involve
and
positive
and
money
spend
and
money
come
in
for
it
a
and
it
be
a
big
event
for
it
and
I
can
see
the
concern
and
they
be
fortunate
and
they
have
it
and
we
would
have
be
concern
if
it
be
certainly
in
we
area
and
we
have
the
decision
and
that
be
what
the
leader
do
and
this
time
they
get
away
with
it
certainly
fortunate
that
nobody
be
kill
Thomas
von
Essen
and
Diana
Loeshen
thank
you
as
well
we
be
continue
to
see
the
flooding
in
Midwest
and
we
will
be
follow
the
story
there
with
the
river
water
still
rise
have
a
listen
to
a
witness
this
be
unbelievable
this
be
like
totally
totally
crazy
I
have
never
in
my
entire
life
see
anything
like
this
before
she
be
talk
about
this
the
river
around
Louis
Missouri
and
include
the
Mississippi
be
out
of
they
bank
cover
the
entire
town
and
house
up
to
the
rooftop
about
9
million
people
in
17
state
right
now
be
either
out
of
they
home
or
nervously
watch
the
water
rise
around
they
the
flood
level
in
Missouri
and
Illinois
will
be
a
record
and
that
be
a
conversation
for
the
day
after
the
water
recede
and
local
official
right
now
focus
on
the
elevee
and
whether
they
will
hold
Jennifer
Gray
be
there
in
Missouri
Park
and
be
there
by
the
floodwater
for
a
couple
off
day

Jennifer
that
be
the
Meramec
River
and
you
be
15
mile
from
the
Mississippi
River
and
what
be
happen
now
because
as
you
and
I
have
be
talk
about
this
this
over
the
last
couple
of
day
the
concern
be
that
the
wear
the
have
to
go
somewhere
downstream
and
the
community
down
downstream
be
face
danger
yes
this
be
a
concern
not
only
for
the
day
but
the
week
ahead
all
of
this
water
for
if
the
MERAMEC
be
flow
into
the
Mississippi
and
all
of
the
wear
ter
be
go
to
go
into
the
Gulf
of
Mexico
a
nd
we
be
talk
about
it
reach
Baton
Rouge
and
New
Orleans
area
by
the
middle
of
January
so
it
be
something
that
we
will
be
talk
about
for
a
while
where
I
be
in
Meramec
that
river
crest
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
and
it
have
go
down
six
foot
but
it
be
still
a
incredible
show
of
water
but
sign
be
show
that
it
be
go
down
the
green
sign
water
be
a
foot
below
that
sign
yesterday
and
you
can
see
how
much
it
have
go
down
but
take
a
look
at
this
on
the
ground
this
be
what
be
go
to
be
leave
behind
look
at
this
all
of
the
silt
and
the
mud
from
the
river
anyone
home
or
business
even
thet
street
that
be
all
flood
this
be
what
go
to
be
leave
behind
and
so
folk
be
go
to
have
to
clean
all
of
this
up
and
not
only
that
but
there
be
sewerage
in
the
water
and
trash
in
the
water
and
they
will
be
clean
for
day
and
week
Jim
it
be
go
to
be
a
long
road
ahead
for
the
people
around
the
Louis
area
and
point
south
well
I
remember
that
the
first
time
we
see
you
that
overpass
bridge
be
nearly
cover
up
to
the
top
and
Jennifer
Gray
thank
you
very
much
it
be
nice
to
see
the
water
come
down
and
on
I
--
and
now
on
the
phone
be
the
mayor
who
be
able
to
tell
we
about
the
condition
of
he
town
and
can
you
tell
we
about
the
condition
of
you
town
and
the
immediate
danger
there
we
be
in
the
next
phase
I
would
call
it
the
good
part
be
that
we
have
jeffcoat
boulevard
open
and
actually
231
open
but
the
problem
be
that
we
have
become
a
island
and
you
know
it
get
a
little
scary
for
people
the
fact
be
that
the
water
be
recede
and
the
report
this
morning
it
be
at
and
the
crest
now
as
we
speak
the
crest
top
edge
be
at
the
highest
and
so
as
you
can
see
it
be
recede
which
be
awesome
the
next
process
that
we
will
be
deal
with
be
the
cleanup
and
with
that
cleanup
I
guess
that
one
of
the
most
important
thing
for
the
resident
be
that
we
want
to
get
the
electricity
the
company
have
to
turn
it
off
they
decide
to
turn
it
off
and
they
have
to
because
of
the
safety
issue
and
now
this
be
now
they
be
go
through
the
process
of
cleanup
and
do
the
inspection
and
we
have
people
on
the
ground
now
and
have
we
inspector
there
be
long
with
Amoran
Electric
to
get
electricity
back
on
and
we
will
have
month
and
month
and
week
and
week
of
cleanup
and
so
it
can
not
be
dispose
of
in
a
normal
procedure
and
mayor
you
be
have
say
it
be
the
most
devastating
flood
in
the
history
of
Arnold
Missouri
and
what
help
do
you
need
in
the
coming
day
and
week
in
the
cleanup
and
recovery
well
we
have
reach
out
and
we
have
wonderful
and
I
mean
it
a
plan
emergency
management
group
and
we
kick
it
in
and
I
think
that
we
have
really
ahead
of
the
issue
that
a
lot
of
the
community
do
not
have
and
we
response
team
be
ready
to
go
and
we
have
boot
on
the
ground
be
from
day
one
and
we
have
be
work
hard
and
reach
out
now
we
have
the
National
Guard
have
be
wonderful
and
they
be
in
the
town
help
we
we
have
all
of
the
different
e
entity
--
the
Fire
Department
all
of
the
entity
be
together
we
meet
every
morning
at
to
find
out
what
we
need
be
and
assess
that
and
then
we
have
three
call
center
and
command
center
for
people
to
call
in
and
get
one
answer
one
of
the
biggest
problem
that
we
have
have
in
of
course
in
the
news
media
and
you
realize
be
the
misinformation
that
e
people
get
and
sometimes
the
people
want
to
know
what
they
hear
be
true
or
not
and
we
be
try
to
stop
that
and
so
right
now
we
be
do
well
well
and
we
have
have
great
resource
Walmart
have
come
to
we
help
and
need
and
home
depot
and
Lowe
and
we
have
have
these
group
that
have
come
to
help
we
and
we
have
convoy
come
in
and
they
be
bring
in
clean
zup
ply
to
be
available
at
the
local
rec
center
where
the
people
when
they
get
into
the
cleanup
area
they
will
be
how
to
cleanup
period
and
what
to
do
with
it
if
you
touch
the
water
a
all
of
this
and
I
mean
there
be
sewer
area
up
river
broken
ta
be
go
to
be
create
some
issue
for
we
so
it
be
not
clean
water
but
contaminate
water
and
so
it
have
to
be
specifically
deal
with
in
a
certain
way
so
if
you
put
it
together
I
think
that
right
now
we
be
look
good
we
be
address
the
issue
that
we
have
and
ton
of
people
out
there
on
the
ground
and
today
be
new

we
be
with
the

I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you
doctor
if
it
be
right
for
you
this
be
CNN

news
break

this
be

that

yet
another
example
of
Natalie
Cole
find

that
be
what
the
family
be
allude
to
in

some
remember
she

we
have
two
serial
killer
s
in
the
area
and
she
come
up

maybe
the
weapon
be
still
here
there
be
still
more
fallout
from
death
of
Laquan
McDonald
at
the
hand
of
Chicago
police
14
month
after
the
teen
be
repeatedly
shoot
by
a
officer
now
charge
with
murder
one
month
after
the
city
release
this
video
support
that
charge
thousand
of
e-mail
to
and
from
city
lawyer
and
official
and
aide
to
Mayor
Rahm
Emanuel
have
be
make
public
they
be
show
that
the
case
be
high
on
the
radar
at
City
Hall
long
before
it
be
a
national
outrage
Rosa
Flores
have
be
do
a
lot
of
the
the
speed
reading
of
the
e-mail
and
so
Rosa
be
as
you
and
I
have
talk
about
there
be
allegation
that
the
mayor
sit
on
this
video
in
effect
so
as
not
to
affect
he
chance
for
reelection
and
be
you

to
s
support
that
well
Jim
we
be

because
there
be
thousand
of
page
but
so
far
no
smoking
gun
or

I
indicate
what
you
be
say
but
let
I
put
you
up
to
e
speed
here
and
CNN
request
all
of
the
e-mail
that
be
either
write
by
the
mayor
or
send
to
the
m
mayor
receive
by
mayor
involve
the
Laquan
McDonald
shooting
and
so
we
receive
thousand
of
page
this
be
the
gist
of
it
what
be
happen

be
that
we

behind
the
scene
of
what

happen
while

learn
about
this

so
what
we
be
read
in
the
e-mail
these
e-mail
be
the
back
and
forth
between
the
Communications
Department
the
legal
department
and
message
to
the
independent
police
review
authority
and
to
the
state
attorney
office
and
the
conversation
of
how
to
craft
the
message
but
again
Jim
we
be
look
through
the
e-mail
and
try
to
figure
out
if
there

exactly
a
smoking
gun

yet
Rosa
Flores
I
be
glad
that

part
of
the
team
that
get
these
e-mail
out
and
make
they
public
thank
you
for
join
we
today
and
the
founder
of
Apple
Steve
Jobs
leave
a
indelible
mark
on
the
kcountry
and
indeed
the
world
he
be
the
subject
of
a
documentary
this
Sunday
night
and
we
legal
anchor
Ashleigh
Banfield
give
aus
preview
the
founder
of
Apple
Steve
Jobs
have
be
call
the
pioneer
of
the
personal
Co
computer
in
more
recent
year
before
the
death
he
introduce
d
to
we
the
ipod
to
the
iPHONE
and
to
the
ipad
but
there
be
more
to
man
than
the
product
and
he
company
CNN
film
be
present
Steve
Jobs
the
man
and
the
machine
on
January
3rd
to
explore
the
myth
the
mystery
and
the
man
behind
that
machine
here
be
a
peek
Steve
have
long
hair
down
he
back
he
have
a
Ho
Chi
Minh
Beard
cutoff
Birk
en
stock
and
Wozniak
be
just
a
few
step
above
that
and
I
say
what
be
STEVE
MCKENNA
well
what
be
a
MCKENNA
I
say
a
person
so
you
have
a
understanding
of
the
man
and
the
machine
and
what
do
not
we
know
about
this
guy
who
seem
to
have
a
headline
even
after
the
death
every
month
ah
I
think
that
there
be
a
fair
amount
that
we
do
not
know
I
think
that
the
main
thing
that
people
do
not
understand
be
how
he
change
how
he
go
from
the
--
he
have
the
bratty
side
throughout
he
life
and
a
lot
of
people
feel
include
I
when
he
call
I
to
yell
at
I
about
a
article
I
be
write
and
he
do
not
have
time
for
the
pleasantry
and
he
go
from
the
kid
who
found
a
company
and
do
not
know
how
the
run
a
company
or
a
division
or
how
to
manage
people
and
who
be
kind
of
the
bad
side
omnipresent
to
be
a
mature
leader
who
have
a
core
group
of
five
or
six
or
seven
guy
who
stay
with
he
over
a
decade
and
create
one
great
product
after
another
to
I
that
be
the
essential
thing
that
people
do
not
understand
he
and
one
great
product
after
another
do
not
begin
the
change
that
this
man
have
kcreatd
globally
and
honest
ly
I
don
think
that
there
be
anyone
else
who
have
singly
have
such
a
effect
on
the
communication
in
the
world
and
yes
that
be
right
in
term
of
the
communication
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
invention
of
the
telephone
or
the
telegraph
before
that
in
term
of
the
revolutionize
the
way
that
people
live
you
know
you
think
about
the
automobile
maybe
but
a
lot
of
people
while
they
revere
what
this
person
have
put
into
we
hand
do
not
know
about
the
darker
side
of
he
I
mean
he
be
not
always
play
clean
and
that
be
very
true
he
basically
live
he
life
believe
that
there
be
a
set
of
rule
for
everybody
else
that
do
not
apply
to
he
which
be
why
he
drive
a
car
with
no
license
plate
and
he
would
park
in
the
spot
reserve
for
the
handicapped
and
he
would
be
blunt
and
brutal
to
people
all
of
that
be
true
and
one
of
the
thing
that
the
f
film
really
do
pretty
well
be
to
bring
a
lot
of
that
out
and
there
be
some
who
say
that
he
would
be
in
jail
today
for
some
of
the
underreporting
of
the
income
and
harbor
income
overseas
well
harbor
the
income
overseas
be
not
illegal
but
talk
about
and
not
report
be
it
yes
and
if
you
be
evasive
to
authority
about
the
accounting
practice
and
report
practice
that
be
where
you
will
get
into
trouble
and
there
be
two
issue
with
he
and
one
be
the
and
should
he
have
disclose
more
about
the
health
as
probably
the
single
most
important
ceo
of
the
country
and
the
person
most
valuable
to
he
company
than
anybody
else
and
do
he
have
a
responsibility
to
tell
people
and
tell
investor
more
about
the
health
and
I
argue
that
the
answer
be
yes
and
he
say
no
and
the
decide
not
to
do
anything
and
in
part
because
he
be
Steve
Jobs
there
be
a
fairly
serious
accounting
issue
to
do
with
the
back
dated
stock
option
and
he
be
the
master
mind
behind
it
or
cause
it
to
happen
other
people
take
the
fall
include
a
former
general
counsel
and
another
man
again
the
feds
decide
to
not
go
after
Steve
Jobs
in
part
because
they
be
sintimidate
y
the
idea
that
they
would
get
if
they
go
after
he
and
intimidation
for
they
if
they
go
after
he
yes
the
investing
community
and
the
populous
at
large
would
be
--
too
big
to
prosecution
yeah
he
and
bank
of
America
there

thank
you

the

I

Ian

be
follow
the
so
story
for
we
from

a
number
of
unanswered
question
e
yian
and
what
Canu
tell
we
about
this
attack
or
about
the
gunman
well
Brianna
the
two
big
answer
be
who
be
this
gunman
where
be
this
gunman
and
be
this
a
criminal
act
or
the
terrorist
attack
we
hear
on
channel
2
the
minister
of
public
security
come
out
to
say
they
still
do
not
know
who
it
be
or
the
motivation
behind
it
so
as
we
be
see
in
the
shop
and
the
market
a
man
who
appear
the
be
buy
something
and
then
he
return
the
item
and
put
the
bag
on
the
shopping
cart
and
that
be
when
he
ge
out
the
gun
and
start
to
spray
the
sidewalk
two
people
be
kill
abfour
be
now
in
serious
condition
and
right
now
a
massive
manhunt
be
under
way
and
the
spokesman
say
that
it
be
flood
with
the
police
officer
look
for
the
suspect
in
Tel
Aviv
and
they
be
say
that
the
resident
should
go
about
they
normal
life
but
be
more
cautious
of
go
between
place
and
be
on
the
street
burk
right
now
that
suspect
that
gunman
be
still
very
much
at
large
Bri
Brianna
thank
you
Ian
Lee
for
that
update
stay
overseas
tension
be
lessen
the
to
today
after
a
credible
threat
lead
to
the
closure
of
a
couple
of
key
station
there
the
station
be
open
and
they
be
very
much
on
alert
Fred
Pleitgen
be
there
for
we
what
be
the
official
look
f
for
specific
areally
well
Brianna
the
information
come
from
french
and
american
intelligence
and
one
tof
the
reason
that
the
german
act
sod
quickly
be
because
they
get
this
information
separately
from
two
allied
intelligence
agency
and
the
information
match
exactly
the
same
two
railway
station
in
Munich
and
the
amount
of
people
be
exactly
the
same
and
five
to
seven
attacker
want
to
conduct
suicide
attack
and
the
timing
be
the
same
in
information
on
midnight
of
new
year
eve
and
the
Germans
say
that
they
realize
there
could
be
a
imminent
threat
to
the
new
year
celebration
there
in
Munich
when
they
get
the
information
it
be
8le
in
Germany
and
they
say
if
we
take
the
time
to
see
if
it
be
true
or
false
we
might
be
put
the
population
in
danger
and
that
why
they
close
all
of
the
place
down
and
there
there
be
a
press
conference
by
the
german
authority
where
where
they
say
that
the
people
involve
be
to
be
of
iraqi
and
seyrian
decent
and
they
have
maim
that
some
of
the
information
contain
of
the
possible
people
and
they
be
try
to
verify
whether
they
be
real
people
or
phony
name
but
as
you
say
at
this
point
in
time
it
seem
as
though
the
threat
level
paz
pass
at
least
but
the
german
people
be
very
much
on
guard
Brianna
and
now
the
incident
at
a
mosque
there
and
what
do
you
know
about
this
it
be
generally
go
to
play
into
the
situation
here
in
Europe
where
a
lot
of
the
constant
alert
of
terror
attack
of
course
in
Brussels
where
the
new
year
eve
celebration
be
cancel
and
incident
in
Munich
and
now
in
the
France
in
the
outskirts
in
the
Alps
there
be
guard
of
a
mosque
because
the
French
be
put
more
manpower
into
that
type
the
of
area
and
a
man
try
to
run
they
overment
they
open
fire
wound
he
severe
ly
in
the
LG
and
the
arm
but
he
have
be
take
into
custody
and
it
be
unclear
the
motivation
at
this
point
in
time
and
the
french
authority
have
come
out
to
say
they
believe
it
be
a
isolate
incident
but
they
have
not
question
he
yet
we
will
follow
that
Fred
Pleitgen
in
London
and
several
city
have
mute
celebration
Belgium
Rochester
New
York
and
they
cancel
they
celebration
so
that
police
could
be
more
mobile
after
this
man
be
arrest
for
a
attack
we
learn
more
about
this
man
Emanuel
Lutchman
and
he
have
a
criminal
history
and
a
desire
to
join
isis
and
what
do
we
know
about
he
he
be
25
year
old
and
serve
about
five
year
in
Attica
for
a
robbery
conviction
and
it
be
then
he
convert
to
Islam
and
upon
the
release
he
be
radicalize
on
line
the
plan
be
to
use
a
pressure
cooker
bomb
to
plant
it
inside
of
a
restaurant
on
new
year
eve
and
also
to
take
hostage
and
he
go
to
Walmart
with
the
undercover
informant
to
buy
tool
for
that
attack
include
the
black
zip
mask
and
knife
and
machete
among
other
item
the
bar
under
attack
there
in
Rochester
New
York
but
the
people
say
that
the
fear
do
not
deter
they
I
own
a
few
establishment
downtown
and
so
it
be
scary
but
then
I
think
we
have
great
security
pass
and
great
police
presence
there
on
the
avenue
and
they
be
try
to
put
the
fear
into
we
and
we
will
not
let
it
happen
and
they
act
in
time
because
LUTCHMAN
record
a
video
of
himself
take
responsibility
for
the
attack
and
obviously
do
not
take
place
with
the
help
of
a
undercover
informant
Br
Brianna
thank
you
for
the
new
detail
and
I
appreciate
it
I
want
to
talk
more
about
the
terror-related
headline
and
we
have
CNN
analyst
Kimberly
Dozier
and
KCOLONEL
cedric
latent
and
he
be
also
a
former
intelligence
officer
and
training
at
the
NSA
Colonel
more
likely
for
a
plot
to
be
carry
out
in
Europe
or
here
in
the
United
States
well
Brianna
that
be
the
big
question
for
the
author
I
the
the
right
now
I
would
say
far
more
like
ly
in
Europe
because
of
the
preponderance
of
the
muslim
population
there
and
the
fact
that
there
be
far
more
islamic
state
sympathizer
in
Europe
than
you
would
find
in
the
United
States
but
have
say
that
Rochester
clearly
show
that
it
be
possible
for
something
to
happen
in
the
United
States
as
well
I
want
to
talk
to
you
Kim
about
this
arrest
in
Rochester
and
the
threat
of
Isis
in
America
a
when
you
look
at
Thshg
what
do
it
tell
you
about
how
the
Isis
strategy
may
be
change
well
the
suspect
be
the
kind
of
the
classic
individual
that
they
have
be
go
after
online
wx
online
with
the
quarter
million
tweet
or
whatever
they
have
each
day
and
they
be
look
for
people
disenfranchise
and
they
do
not
have
a
way
to
get
ahead
and
they
work
on
they
and
bring
they
over
and
the
expert
in
counter
violent
extremism
say
there
be
a
push
and
pull
to
bring
somebody
into
the
fold
may
they
feel
that
the
world
be
unjust
and
that
the
government
have
not
pay
attention
to
they
and
maybe
abuse
by
the
government
the
pull
be
come
be
part
of
the
team
and
something
important
and
this
be
generally
something
that
the
individual
would
not
have
ak
be
cess
to
in
he
daily
life
and
so
it
be
a
siren
song
that
the
and
the
West
have
not
figure
out
how
to
combat
yet
yes
it
be
a
very
good
point
and
Colonel
there
be
a
new
study
out
by
George
Washington
Univ
University
and
it
be
look
for
the
number
of
Isis
arrest
and
this
year
60
isis-related
arrest
in
the
United
States
compare
to
15
record
Ed
in
the
study
for
2014
of
all
of
those
in
the
study
the
average
age
here
be
26
year
old
and
86
%
be
man
40
%
of
those
arrest
be
convert
New
York
governor
anp
draw
Cuomo
say
that
the
suspect
in
Rochester
be
probably
radicalize
hd
in
prison
so
what
do
this
say
about
the
arrest
from
2014
to
2015
well
s
it
be
troubling
Brianna
and
you
be
see
the
fervor
of
the
kconvert
those
who
be
convert
by
Al
Qaeda
in
prison
or
other
means
as
Kimberly
say
they
be
the
people
who
do
not
make
it
in
society
and
so
isis
be
use
the
same
technique
that
we
subscribe
to
the
military
that
we
can
convince
people
that
they
be
go
go
the
be
a
part
of
something
greater
than
themselves
and
do
some
good
but
in
this
case
the
good
be
really
evil
that
be
what
be
so
troubling
about
this
something
else
that
stand
out
be
86
%
be
man
and
that
mean
that
14
%
be
woman
and
what
do
that
tell
you
Kim
that
be
a
number
of
woman
and
so
isis
have
create
a
space
for
the
woman
in
the
campaign
and
convince
d
they
t
have
a
role
and
not
just
as
the
Isis
slave
which
be
what
the
West
and
the
have
try
to
put
out
as
a
counter
message
but
as
part
of
the
process
not
at
the
front
line
but
bring
bring
young
man
support
they
the
on
the
battlefield
so
what
it
show
you
be
that
you
really
need
to
come
up
with
the
State
Department
and
other
who
have
not
yet
come
up
with
a
counter
message
that
say
that
beyond
just
a
lecture
oh
you
do
not
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
and
the
struggle
be
how
do
they
find
authentic
voice
across
the
muslim
world
and
help
to
support
they
without
in
a
sense
sully
they
by
association
and
how
do
you
invisibly
sort
of
x
exaggerate
the
voice
of
the
people
that
have
the
message
that
you
want
out
there
and
something
else
colonel
that
in
the
Rochester
case
be
that
he
go
to
Walmart
and
get
zip
tie
and
ammonia
and
machete
and
a
ski
mask
and
what
be
you
--
I
mean
that
to
the
I
a
miss
opportunity
for
someone
to
say
these
be
some
odd
assortment
of
thing
to
be
purchase
together
absolutely
and
it
be
show
that
we
be
all
on
the
front
line
of
this
effort
against
Isis
and
what
we
be
deal
with
here
be
a
situation
to
where
those
kind
of
indicator
can
happen
in
the
daily
life
so
if
you
be
a
cash
year
at
Walmart
you
have
to
pay
attention
to
that
kind
of
stuff
but
by
the
same
toke
even
if
you
be
the
neighbor
of
the
people
like
the
San
Bernardino
people
you
need
to
know
what
be
go
on
enough
to
really
a
actually
say
hey
there
be
something
go
on
here
and
it
be
the
old
see
something
say
something
in
this
day
and
age
and
if
you
do
not
say
something
about
this
the
result
could
be
very
very
tragic
and
we
be
hear
that
more
and
more
in
recent
day
hear
something
say
something
and
Kimberly
dose
r
and
Cedric
Layten
thank
you
thank
you
happy
new
year
and
the
Taliban
be
claim
responsibility
for
at
a
tack
in
a
restaurant
that
be
popular
among
e-patriot

one
person

the
blast

and
the
major
shake-up
in
Ben
Carson
campaign
on
Fox
News
Carson
explain
why
the
change
be
necessary
well
you
know
we
do
a
deep
dive
and
recognize
that
there
be
some
area
of
deficiency
have
say
that
we
must
be
recognize
that
the
team
that
we
have
they
take
a
very
unlikely
scenario
and
a
complete
outsider
and
they
put
he
in
a
competitive
position
where
nobody
think
it
be
remotely
possible
so
kudos
be
for
kudos
where
they
be
need
but
in
fact
we
be
move
into
a
different
phase
and
we
need
something
different
we
have
bring
it
into
place
and
we
have
major
difference
of
have
operator
now
this
be
something
that
I
discover
work
manage
the
corporate
world
for
decade
you
could
have
people
with
very
good
idea
but
you
have
to
have
have
operator
to
effectuate
the
change
and
he
have
bring
on
board
general
dee
who
be
live
with
Frus
Austin
Texas
and
one
of
the
thing
ts
that
we
hear
Carter
talk
about
be
the
area
of
deficiency
and
what
area
be
he
talk
about
well
Brianna
happy
2016
to
you
thank
you
it
be
go
to
be
a
pivotal
year
in
american
history
primarily
the
need
and
the
agility
to
communicate
we
policy
and
strategy
around
the
country
related
to
the
campaign
we
know
that
source
be
tell
we
Sarah
Murray
that
Carson
be
now
look
ging
for
livelier
tone
as
he
go
to
be
head
toward
the
final
stretch
toward
the
Iowa
caucus
and
really
that
one
of
the
sort
of
the
thing
that
the
campaign
be
go
to
be
do
be
face-to-face
contact
with
the
Iowa
voter
and
really
at
that
grass
root
level
try
to
convince
they
that
he
be
the
guy
for
the
job
can
you
tell
we
more
about
that
well
of
course
Bri
Brianna
we
have
a
great
team
and
there
be
a
false
narrative
that
we
be
lose
momentum
and
energy
but
it
be
the
opposite
we
have
a
lot
of
energy
on
the
ground
in
Iowa
and
Ryan
Roach
there
and
we
talk
about
the
thing
that
maybe
we
need
to
prove
and
we
be
do
a
lot
of
thing
right
but
the
reality
be
that
in
fund-raising
and
social
media
and
the
field
operation
we
be
in
good
shape
Ed
Brookover
be
the
campaign
manager
and
he
be
a
great
quarterback
in
college
football
and
he
be
a
quarterback
overall
to
be
a
orchestrator
of
this
effort
as
well
and
you
be
make
a
shift
there
and
you
be
now
the
chairman
and
what
be
before
campaign
manager
Barry
Bennett
resign
and
Lisa
Cohen
step
down
the
and
Doug
Watts
resign
as
well
so
people
when
they
look
at
this
and
they
think
that
it
be
a
shake-up
and
chaos
you
think
that
they
be
misread
this
oh
of
course
we
have
have
five
departure
and
we
have
not
have
any
major
impact
to
the
campaign
and
in
fact
we
be
go
to
be
much
more
agile
we
have
have
a
policy
engine
that
be
idle
and
we
will
take
the
governor
of
off
of
that
and
allow
the
people
of
America
to
see
what
Ben
Carson
believe
about
certain
thing
and
we
have
have
a
communication
strategy
passive
instead
of
active
and
we
will
change
that
immediately
and
we
be
stand
up
a
entire
policy
directive
and
bring
in
new
player
that
be
expert
in
the
field
and
world
class
expert
and
we
be
excite
about
the
that
and
as
I
say
it
be
a
time
thef
of
energy
and
a
time
of
look
forward
to
the
new
year
and
really
a
time
of
press
hard
into
Iowa
and
beyond
we
have
see
Carson
fall
in
the
poll
and
he
be
do
very
good
before
and
now
he
be
the
distant
third
place
behind
Marco
Rubio
and
so
when
he
look
at
that
what
do
he
attribute
the
slide
to
I
do
not
think
that
Carson
be
try
to
attribute
to
the
slide
we
be
deal
with
the
reality
and
we
be
excite
to
have
the
pent
up
potential
and
the
american
people
do
not
really
know
he
there
be
a
narrative
that
say
that
he
would
not
be
qualify
as
the
manager
of
chief
and
it
be
nothing
but
he
have
the
right
reflex
to
be
the
commander
in
chief
and
who
else
have
have
more
call
and
who
have
make
more
life
and
death
scenario
and
who
do
we
want
to
have
the
firng
on
the
nuclear
code
of
the
country
and
who
caninner-city
and
inspire
the
young
african-american
boy
in
the
inner
city
I
be
convinced
it
be
Ben
Carson
who
be
the
person
at
this
time
of
we
nation
history
to
heal
and
revive
and
revere
this
exceptional
nation
and
he
be
struggle
on
the
foreign
policy
and
he
himself
have
say
that
in
the
wake
of
the
terrorist
attack
be
that
people
doubt
he
kred
when
it
come
to
the
area
of
policy
and
you
be
the
foreign
policy
adviser
before
take
over
as
chairman
and
how
do
he
confront
that
issue
and
those
concern
that
voter
have
about
he
well
first
way
to
confront
it
be
for
he
simply
to
show
people
what
he
know
and
for
people
to
listen
Carson
know
a
lot
of
foreign
policy
and
I
be
amaze
when
I
talk
to
he
at
the
depth
and
the
brept
of
the
foreign
policy
and
not
just
foreign
policy
but
every
policy
and
for
a
man
to
stand
five
foot
be
from
the
president
of
the
United
States
and
talk
common
sense
solution
and
declare
truth
be
tremendous
moral
courage
and
knowledge
people
be
say
that
be
Solomon
talk
with
the
wisdom
about
all
of
the
problem
that
we
nation
face
so
he
be
not
a
newcomer
to
any
of
this
but
he
have
be
talk
this
and
live
it
and
that
have
he
be
whole
life
story
and
I
do
not
believe
it
be
a
deficiency
at
all
we
need
to
get
that
word
out
you
be
talk
about
the
prayer
breakfast
right
yes
the
prayer
breakfast
where
he
--
and
this
that
be
when
he
burst
on
to
the
scene
take
on
president
Obama
and
so
thank
you
the
new
chairman
of
the
Ben
Carson
campaign
thank
you
Brianna
this
shake-up
be
just
little
more
than
four
week
before
the
Iowa
caucus
and
so
it
be
go
to
be
under
way
so
soon
and
with
a
look
at
the
road
ahead
of
2016
be
we
CNN
political
reporter
Sarah
Murray
I
be
excite
about
the
2016
and
say
let
get
the
show
on
the
road
it
have
be
a
long
walk-up
and
what
be
the
impact
of
the
car
Carson
Campaign
shake-up
because
it
be
so
close
to
the
first
contest
into
the
first
vote
of
the
RIS
well
the
reality
they
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
in
the
short
amount
of
time
and
you
hear
the
new
campaign
manager
say
they
will
overhaul
the
communication
strategy
and
also
new
reform
strategy
but
that
be
good
if
it
be
a
few
month
ago
so
when
Ben
Carson
be
barnstorm
people
have
to
have
a
conversation
with
he
and
trust
that
he
be
the
guy
to
be
commander
in
chief
and
the
fact
be
that
he
have
not
demonstrate
the
strength
and
knowledge
up
to
this
point
it
be
a
tough
thing
to
turn
around
in
a
couple
of
week
yes
he
have
the
work
cut
out
for
he
and
now
talk
to
Donald
Trump
and
this
be
what
he
say
to
Fox
News
last
night
well
I
hope
that
you
be
go
to
be
call
the
whits
Ho
--
White
House
and
I
promise
that
you
will
get
through
and
you
be
always
invite
and
we
will
do
something
special
to
make
amends
of
the
mistake
over
the
year
I
hope
that
you
be
go
to
be
call
the
White
House
that
be
the
new
year
resolution
to
become
president
he
get
in
a
jab
of
Hillary
Clinton
Sarah
and
he
say
that
I
think
that
I
will
be
she
worst
nightmare
be
this
feud
between
trump
and
the
Clintons
be
be
go
to
simmer
down
or
get
worse
I
think
it
be
go
to
escalate
Brianna
because
when
Donald
Trump
talk
he
be
so
optimistic
and
he
be
talk
like
he
have
win
the
republican
primary
and
in
a
general
election
battle
with
Hillary
Clinton
that
be
how
he
be
talk
on
the
campaign
trail
too
and
go
after
Hillary
Clinton
harder
in
recent
day
than
some
of
the
republican
rival
and
I
think
that
also
by
put
the
thing
that
he
have
put
on
the
table
in
the
last
couple
of
day
bill
Clinton
past
and
the
infidelity
and
the
whole
character
assassination
and
we
will
hear
a
lot
more
of
that
and
where
he
be
concern
there
be
not
a
lot
off
limit
no
and
bill
Clinton
be
go
to
be
hit
the
campaign
trail
this
week
for
he
wife
and
we
will
see
how
he
handle
that
and
Ted
Cruz
be
expect
to
raise
$
20
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
the
poll
number
hsh
he
be
go
to
get
some
mo
momentum
and
be
he
really
the
most
formidable
challenge
to
Donald
Trump
at
this
point
well
right
now
when
you
look
at
the
ground
game
in
Iowa
Ted
Cruz
be
abslout
--
absolutely
the
biggest
rival
to
Donald
Trump
he
be
build
a
bigger
base
and
Donald
Trump
be
talk
about
bring
in
the
new
voter
and
republican
who
have
not
vote
before
or
voter
in
40
year
and
Democrats
who
want
to
vote
for
the
Republican
be
more
difficult
than
what
Ted
Cruz
be
say
turn
out
the
evangelical
base
and
yet
people
on
the
ground
in
Iowa
say
that
there
be
week
the
go
and
the
Iowa
voter
break
late
so
possibly
that
the
resurgence
be
come
too
early
for
comfort
a
he
ahead
of
the
wave
thank
you
Sarah
Murray
happy
for
you
yes
you
too
and
investigator
ri
ing
too
to
figure
out
what
cause
a
fire
to
rip
through
in
hotel
in
Dubai
and
a
forever
who
be
post
64
floor
up
plea
for
help
on
the
social
media
as
he
plan
to
repel
down
the
building
the
whole
thing
catch
on
camera
we
will
play
it
for
you
after
this
be
you
live
with

side

and
orderly
and
other
say
that
people
be
scream
and
cry
try

escape
the
flame
and
16
people
be
treat
for
mostly
minor
injury
and
the
spectacular
firework
deplace
go
on
as
plan
even
though
the
building
block
away
be
still
burn
ing
we
be
learn
about
the
dramatic
survival
story
there
include
a
photographer
who
stake
out
the
perfect
vantage
point
and
then
he
find
himself
stick
and
trap
by
flame
and
smoke
on
the
48th
floor
of
the
the
burning
hotel
Ultimat
ultimately
he
be
rescue
but
it
be
not
before
a
very
harrowing
ordeal
we
be
on
the
48th
floor
of
the
address
hotel
happen
Ing
right
now
yes
I
can
see
it
right
there
yes
oh
my
goodness
I
can
not
imagine
what
be
go
through
he
mind
but
we
will
because
that
photographer
Dennis
Mallari
be
join
we
by
phone
from
Dubai
tell
we
Dennis
what
be
happen
in
this
building
and
you
be
stick
hi
Brianna
my
first
thing
I
do
be
to
take
a
couple
of
picture
and
so
there
be
another
photographer
who
be
on
there
and
immediate
ly
e
take
the
camera
and
let
go
man
let
es
go
Dennis
and
soy
take
a
couple
of
picture
just
a
couple
of
picture
and
it
be
around
one
minute
and
then
I
be
head
to
get
and
grab
some
extra
camera
and
the
smoke
that
be
head
to
the
exit
and
that
be
when
you
realize
that
you
route
for
escape
be
block
so
you
come
up
with
a
a
plan
to
escape
and
maybe
one
out
of
desperation
and
tell
we
what
you
be
go
to
do
I
try
twice
but
the
wind
keep
change
and
the
smoke
keep
come
back
and
it
come
my
experience
that
a
lot
of
the
people
die
from
the
smoke
and
not
because
of
the
fire
look
I
step
back
and
I
go
back
into
the
open
air
corner
of
the
balcony
from
there
I
simply
pray
very
short
but
very
strong
and
then
it
be
like
a
train
that
be
use
for
clean
the
building
and
so
there
be
a
cable
that
you
ride
and
I
ride
it
down
the
building
and
then
on
the
side
of
the
building
there
be
a
platform
where
they
usually
the
tower
building
they
have
a
light
install
that
every
night
it
blink
every
night
just
to
note
that
there
be
a
building
in
that
area
and
so
then
I
crouch
down
and
then
I
step
out
on
the
side
of
the
building
and
be
so
you
cross
yourself
and
obviously
I
be
sure
that
you
be
come
to
term
with
how
this
be
go
to
be
work
out
for
you
and
this
be
sort
of
a
cable
on
the
crane
that
you
grab
a
hole
of
yes
have
the
support
myself
we
be
see
it
now
some
of
the
video
tell
we
how
long
you
be
there
before
you
be
eventually
rescue
and
tell
we
about
the
rescue
the
total
of
the
time
I
be
there
during
the
time
that
the
fire
start
it
be
around
two
hour
but
I
be
at
the
edge
of
the
building
about
a
hour
I
manage
to
contact
some
friend
on
the
ground
and
I
say
could
you
call
or
approach
anybody
from
civil
defense
and
tell
they
that
I
be
here
on
the
48th
floor
strand
here
and
stick
here
48th
floor
balcony
side
that
be
it
and
then
I
keep
think
that
there
be
somebody
from
the
civil
liberty
who
will
then
stop
it
and
give
they
the
instruction
that
the
guy
inside
of
the
building
and
he
be
on
the
phone
with
I
and
then
he
also
give
instruction
of
the
commun
communication
unbelievable
that
you
get
help
from
friend
who
be
able
to
get
the
rescuer
to
you
and
I
want
to
add
Dennis
you
be
consummate
professional
because
after
this
rescue
and
the
e
escape
for
you
you
then
go
on
to
the
assignment
of
take
picture
of
the
firework
and
amazing
we
be
so
glad
to
be
talk
to
you
today
thank
you
for
join
we
Dennis
thank
you
very
much
and
happy
new
year
to
you
the
fire
at
the
address
hotel
in
d
Dubai
spread
so
intensely
and
it
be
amazing
that
more
people
be
not
hurt
or
kill
and
a
article
say
that
lax
building
code
may
have
be
a
contributor
to
this
and
Michael
Weiss
whox
be
a
senior
editor
of
the
daily
beast
be
join
we
in
New
York
and
now
the
fact
be
do
the
address
hotel
look
like
it
be
build
to
burn
Ut
look
like
it
what
be
some
of
of
the
issue
that
could
have
contribute
to
it
and
Dubai
or
the
UAE
change
the
building
code
in
2013
but
the
problem
be
that
all
of
the
high-rise
building
that
dot
the
landscape
in
this
country
be
make
with
mixture
of
polyurethane
and
aluminum
and
give
the
climate
in
the
Gulf
and
the
hot
temperature
and
the
dry
and
windy
condition
it
can
ignite
this
material
the
platt
it
be
call
the
skin
of
the
building
so
even
though
they
have
enforce
more
stringent
rule
any
building
build
before
2013
include
the
address
be
sus
eptable
to
it
it
be
not
shoddy
workmanship
or
anything
like
that
but
it
be
indicate
that
the
fire
accelerate
so
rapidly
and
eat
up
30
or
40
story
of
the
building
in
less
than
a
hour
and
similar
case
in
March
of
this
year
when
a
building
in
Dubai
unfortunately
name
the
torch
be
the
same
set
of
circumstance
the
polyurethane
and
alum
nim
act
as
a
accelerant
to
the
flame
that
be
what
a
expert
say
to
we
here
at
CNN
that
it
could
have
contribute
Ed
to
the
torching
of
the
building
and
they
say
that
siding
be
come
off
and
a
so
that
be
what
you
be
talk
about
this
polyurethane
stuff
yes
completely
you
mention
the
torch
but
how
extensive
be
this
problem
overall
in
the
Emirates
any
building
go
up
prior
to
two
to
three
year
ago
and
most-rises
that
have
be
construct
and
Dubai
in
particular
be
a
world
hub
for
luxury
shopping
and
trade
and
a
lot
of
the
international
business
go
through
there
and
for
the
last
several
decade
they
have
be
create
the
fake
island
and
right
next
to
or
rather
sort
of
a
stone
throw
away
from
the
address
hotel
be
the
world
tallest
building
at
63
story
and
so
that
be
a
indication
of
the
sort
of
the
you
know
the
sky
scrape
of
this
city
so
anything
that
be
build
onward
have
to
adhere
to
the
regulation
can
they
retro
fit
and
fit
these
building
that
be
almost
like
disaster
wait
to
happen
I
be
sure
they
can
but
do
they
want
to
because
the
expense
of
something
like
that
have
to
be
exorbitant
and
because
there
be
so
many
example
in
the
building
what
be
they
go
to
do
but
if
enough
of
the
building
catch
fire
then
pretty
much
a
ground
swell
of
support
to
do
exactly
that
so
it
be
a
dangerous
set
of
circumstance
you
know
I
think
that
they
should
learn
from
this
and
yes
they
certainly
should
Michael
Weiss
great
insight
with
that
and
we
do
appreciate
it
break

I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major

both
make
switching
to
eliqui

I

Ed
in

and
the

we
have
the
latest
next
this
be
CNN
break

we
do
have
break
news
floodwater
be

in
Illinois
and
not
overtop
a
broken

and
people
in
Alexander
County
be
be
evacuate
and
flooding
in
lower
Mississippi
be
overflow
as
water
will
not
crest
for
day
meteorologist
Allison
Chinchar
be
follow
this
this
be
a
big
deal
and
devasta
devastate
to
the
area
it
be
and
we
not
only
have
one
but
two
levy
breach
and
so
we
want
to
take
a
look
at
those
in
the
similar
area
and
right
here
you
can
see
north
of
the
Memphis
area
and
the
Ohio
and
the
Mississippi
River
come
together
and
this
be
where
we
have
have
they
the
Fayetteville
levee
on
the
east
side
of
the
river
and
dog
tooth
bend
have
start
to
breach
as
we
move
farther
down
this
be
also
a
area
of
concern
because
as
we
push
the
water
a
lot
of
the
area
have
not
see
it
crest
one
of
the
city
Cairo
which
be
part
of
the
southern
part
of
Illinois
that
bridge
there
have
be
shutdown
and
it
be
close
the
problem
be
that
it
be
go
to
be
cause
a
90-minute
detour
if
you
be
plan
to
go
around
some
of
the
area
again

of
the
city

yet
to
see
the
highest
amount

and
Cairo
on
January
49
more
moisture
will
be
float
down
the
Mississippi
River
and
farther
south
where
we
have
the
levee
breach
January
9th
until
we
get
to
Memphis
all
that
water
have
to
make
it
all
the
way
down
it
be
possible
more
levee
could
be
breach
as
you
go
farther
down
the
Mississippi
River
city
like
Greenville
and
Vicksburg
again
not
for
another
ten
day
and
the
other
thing
to
note
too
with
all
these
any
more
rain
we
get
be
go
to
add
more
water
to
a
lot
of
the
river
especially
for
those
not
expect
to
crest
for
another
week
we
have
to
watch
this
the
next
several
day
we
know
you
will

yes
almost
everybody
of
consequence
do
serve
either
they
be
star
before
the

or
they
be
star
after
the

and
yet
you
read
some
of
the
name
of
those
who
serve
Ted
Williams
Joe
Dimaggio
Hang
Greenberg
PEEWEE
reese
Yogi
Berra
Bill
DICKEY
biggest
name
of
they
day
the
biggest
name
of
they
day
in
some
case
be
draft
rather
than
enlist
that
be
not
true
of
Greenberg
Detroit
slugger
hank
Greenberg
leave
first
base
for
the
army
serve
he
time
and
then
go
back
in
Greenberg
who
have
be
draft
in
1940
and
when
he
draft
year
have
be
give
and
Pearl
Harbor
be
bomb
he
enlist
the
very
next
day
baseball
legend
Ted
Williams
be
every
bit
as
legendary
in
the
Marine
Corps
where
he
serve
as
a
fighter
pilot
during
war
the
skill
he
display
in
the
batter
box
prove
even
more
valuable
in
the
cockpit
during
training
he
set
record
that
still
stand
in
the
Marine
Corps
to
this
day
people
like
Ted
Williams
go
over
serve
come
back
and
seem
to
pick
up
right
where
they
leave
off
most
player
be
able
to
do
this
Williams
and
feller
and
Greenberg
return
to
major
league
action
after
year
away
and
pick
it
up
but
there
be
those
who
do
not
people
who
lose
they
skill
or
lose
they
appetite
for
the
game
because
of
what
they
have
see
in
the
war
it
be
also
true
that
a
lot
of
these
guy
be
not
out
there
necessarily
in
front-line
combat
role
but
there
be
a
reason
for
that
Dimaggio
doubles
to
left
center
field
you
could
not
put
Joe
Dimaggio
in
a
situation
where
he
would
be
wound
kill
or
from
a
propaganda
standpoint
worst
of
all
capture
so
the
--
most
of
the
major
league
baseball
player
who
join
the
military
spend
they
time
play
ball
on
Air
Force
and
navy
team
for
the
fight
man
it
be
a
rare
gift
a
chance
to
watch
nine
inning
of
normalcy
rlk
sweet
memory
of
home
and
freedom
of
the
country
they
be
struggle
to
protect
be
there
something
different
about
player
of
the
World
War
II
era
if
I
do
not
know
that
they
be
that
different
but
certainly
time
be
different
the
war
be
different
pt
perceive
threat
to
we
liberty
there
be
no
point
in
have
a
national
past
time
if
the
nation
be
go
to
be
challenge
in
its
basic
tenet
the
idea
of
baseball
be
a
daily
war
which
be
a
metaphor
seem
silly
when
you
be
confront
with
the
horror
of
actual
war
so
player
turn
warrior
serve
they
nation
with
honor
distinction
and
good
old
american
pride
America
have
give
birth
to
baseball
now
baseball
return
the
favor
a
country
scar
by
war
but
stitch
together
in
part
by
a
love
for
the
game
you
might
disagree
with
you
neighbor
about
religion
or
politics
but
it
seem
that
everybody
of
agree
that
baseball
be
a
blessing
in
America
right
behind
where
we
stand
be
the
place
so
many
immigrant
pass
through
on
they
way
to
pursue
the
american
dream
most
make
it
through
Ellis
Island
but
some
be
not
so
lucky
from
they
path
be
less
certain
but
start
down
a
very
specific
hallway
hide
away
from
the
public
for
decade
until
now
we
will
take
you
there
--
next
he
determine
you
be
free
to
go
but
you
you
have
to
stay
well
so
there
be
a
couple
thing
that
have
to
happen
to
be
admit
into
the
hospital
you
have
to
have
something
that
could
be
cure
nearly
half
of
all
Americans
today
have
at
least
one
relative
who
enter
we
country
through
Ellis
Island
a
passage
that
be
not
easy
in
fact
some
never
make
it
through
and
they
story
be
long
forget
until
now
here
be
a
rare
look
at
the
hidden
hallway
of
Ellis
Island
scene
like
this
remind
we
of
we
past
and
one
of
the
most
iconic
place
in
America
--
Ellis
Island
nearly
one-half
of
all
Americans
today
have
at
least
one
relative
to
enter
the
country
through
stination
a
untold
story
exist
just
a
short
walk
away
where
the
less
fortunate
end
up
a
unique
path
only
few
have
walk
since
the
door
close
in
1954
the
hidden
hall
like
Ellis
Island
you
fail
you
medical
inspection
you
would
be
detain
in
the
hospital
complex
would
you
whole
family
have
to
stay
with
you
it
depend
on
who
you
be
if
you
be
a
child
then
a
family
member
stay
on
island
with
you
until
they
determine
whether
or
not
you
be
go
to
be
admit
in
the
hospital
or
deport
back
to
you
home
country
if
you
be
a
husband
or
a
father
and
you
be
detain
then
the
entire
family
would
be
detain
too
this
hallway
be
the
very
same
path
walk
by
immigrant
who
just
learn
the
heartsinking
news
they
would
be
admit
to
the
hospital
so
just
like
people
who
come
here
they
have
to
have
the
right
gear
to
be
let
in
the
country
we
need
the
right
gear
to
check
out
where
we
be
go
you
will
need
to
wear
a
hardhat
I
do
love
my
hardhat
make
I
feel
very
legitimate
ready
let
go
contagious
disease
what
would
screener
look
for
eye
disease
measles
diphtheria
whooping
cough
scarlet
fever
you
guy
clean
up
since
then
right
just
check
the
skeleton
of
the
contagious
disease
ward
still
stand
much
as
it
do
in
the
early
1900
poison
ivy
now
wrap
itself
around
old
window
frame
the
hallway
in
what
be
once
the
largest
hospital
in
the
country
not
everybody
just
get
treat
at
entry
in
the
United
States
you
be
go
to
be
detain
first
they
be
go
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
have
something
that
could
be
treatede
and
cure
really
and
then
find
somebody
who
could
o
pay
for
it
of
the
12
million
people
who
file
through
Ellis
Island
at
its
peak
1
out
of
every
5
people
be
detain
however
less
than
1
%
of
those
detain
be
admit
to
the
hospital
serious
health
detention
though
infrequent
happen
for
many
reason
for
example
approximately
350
baby
call
Ellis
island
they
birthplace
though
they
do
not
get
automatic
citizenship
more
often
health
detention
happen
for
more
common
ailment
who
determine
you
be
free
to
go
but
you
you
have
to
stay
well
so
there
be
a
couple
thing
that
have
to
happen
to
be
admit
into
the
hospital
you
have
to
have
something
that
could
be
cure
and
that
somebody
have
to
pay
for
you
treatment
treatment
here
be
not
free
in
fact
until
a
immigrant
could
determine
who
would
pay
for
they
health
care
the
department
of
labor
who
manage
Ellis
Island
at
the
time
send
the
bill
to
whatever
steam
ship
company
deliver
that
immigrant
how
long
could
you
stay
on
Ellis
Island
say
you
be
find
to
have
a
contagious
disease
people
stay
here
day
week
month
in
year
yes
even
year
yes
and
you
could
have
be
treat
here
for
year
then
the
person
who
be
pay
for
you
treatment
run
out
of
money
then
you
could
still
be
deport
if
you
have
a
contagious
disease
you
would
obviously
be
really
sick
and
you
could
also
unfortunately
not
make
it
right
about
people
do
die
on
Ellis
Island
so
this
be
a
autopsy
amphitheater
a
amphitheater
oh
my
--
this
be
incredible
you
guy
have
to
see
this
a
amphitheater
this
look
like
something
out
of
--
I
do
not
know
medical
school
or
something
like
that
exactly
this
be
a
teaching
hospital
people
be
do
the
residency
here
really
they
be
learn
from
the
doctor
here
on
Ellis
Island
remember
this
be
the
best
hospital
in
the
world
at
the
time
medical
student
would
stand
up
here
and
observe
what
be
happen
absolutely
I
be
presume
the
body
would
be
put
where
that
cart
be
yeah
that
be
probably
not
the
autopsy
table
I
be
go
to
say
that
be
probably
a
table
for
instrument
but
the
gentleman
who
clean
up
these
ward
for
we
say
he
find
that
table
there
in
1972
and
he
have
leave
it
there
since
build
to
hold
750
bed
the
hospital
treat
patient
in
nearly
identical
room
construct
with
a
eye
towards
a
cure
this
be
a
open
ward
a
open
ward
meaning
if
you
be
suffer
from
something
that
a
lot
of
people
have
you
would
be
in
a
room
together
we
affectionately
call
most
of
these
ward
measles
ward
there
would
have
be
a
bed
in
between
each
window
window
would
have
be
open
year
round
for
air
flow
the
corner
be
actually
a
little
bit
round
so
that
air
flow
and
circulation
recently
after
60
year
the
Save
Ellis
Island
Foundation
open
these
ward
for
limited
tour
but
we
receive
some
incredible
access
now
we
be
go
to
go
upstairs
which
be
where
most
people
do
not
get
to
go
this
be
someplace
special
for
we
that
no
one
else
get
to
see
it
be
true
that
be
exciting
what
be
we
go
to
see
up
here
do
you
see
this
chair
this
be
my
favorite
ward
this
be
actually
my
favorite
ward
when
I
see
these
chair
I
want
to
know
who
be
sit
here
last
and
why
have
you
ever
sit
in
that
chair
I
do
not
sit
in
any
of
the
chair
it
look
completely
different
than
the
other
ward
that
we
go
into
it
be
actually
the
next
story
that
I
be
go
to
try
to
explore
with
we
public
programming
it
be
the
story
of
World
War
II
on
Ellis
Island
while
immigration
slow
through
Ellis
island
in
the
1930
and
the
hospital
remain
open
provide
treatment
to
return
serviceman
for
Shell
shock
during
World
War
II
what
be
interesting
be
that
this
whole
place
do
not
have
that
eerie
feeling
that
I
be
expect
know
that
there
be
a
morgue
or
--
and
that
people
stay
here
for
year
I
kind
of
expect
to
have
that
haunt
house
feeling
a
little
bit
but
it
do
not
feel
that
way
in
here
no
to
I
it
be
almost
like
this
whole
level
of
care
that
people
be
give
and
dignity
and
respect
and
how
they
be
treat
here
I
feel
like
I
do
not
necessarily
think
that
there
be
ghost
or
creepy
feeling
it

only
in
you
area
it
be
really
first
America
and
people
do
not
quite
remember
that
and
I
think
that
we
should
when
we
think
of
the
first
people
who
come
to
America
though
we
also
think
of
the
pilgrims
when
do
these
know
the
very
first
this
be
the
first
permanent
english
settlement
and
Plymouth
be
1620
and
without
a
strong
intuition
from
archaeologist
William
Kelso
we
may
not
know
much
about
the
first
settler
because
many
think
they
be
underwater
but
Kelso
have
a
hunch
and
luckily
for
we
he
follow
it
well
I
come
to
the
spot
on
a
tour
with
a
park
ranger
and
I
see
a
expose
bank
with
where
you
could
see
the
soil
layer
and
one
of
they
be
a
dark
layerrier
there
be
artifact
stick
out
and
I
be
not
a
arkle
yol
gist
at
the
time
and
I
say
that
be
pretty
cool
so
I
ask
the
ranger
where
where
be
the
fort
he
say
it
be
wash
into
the
river
and
I
say
what
about
the
Ark
he
could
not
answer
I
without
you
you
to
that
would
it
be
find
no
there
be
a
feeling
of
do
not
disturb
the
past
but
you
have
a
different
feeling
yes
I
think
it
be
time
to
catch
the
brass
ring
and
that
decision
to
deep
dig
deeper
be
to
link
into
the
past
and
now
Kelso
be
part
of
the
Jamestown
PROSKWEKT
he
be
in
a
project
to
find
out
what
happen
here
with
those
man
who
land
here
four
century
ago
he
goal
be
to
bring
it
back
bring
we
back
to
the
very
first
people
who
arrive
here
in
1607
who
be
they
why
do
they
come
well
there
be
100
more
who
make
it
to
Jamestown
to
be
settler
to
be
live
here
they
think
this
be
a
land
of
gold
and
silver
they
really
believe
that
but
they
would
soon
learn
existence
in
the
new
world
face
many
threat
instead
of
the
land
of
gold
andn
silver
it
be
the
land
of
disease
starvation
and
death
mostly
be
just
die
of
hunger
because
it
take
they
five
month
to
get
here
instead
of
five
week
as
they
have
plan
so
they
usedo
up
all
they
provision
on
they
way
they
be
drink
water
from
the
Jamestown
River
which
in
the
spring
it
run
clear
andnd
23resh
but
as
the
spring
go
on
it
become
salty
what
be
more
deadly
the
bad
water
and
the
tough
environment
or
the
native
american
tribe
well
they
be
starve
the
native
too
be
that
because
they
be
not
good
hunter
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
well
eventually
they
be
keep
in
the
fort
they
could
not
venture
beyond
the
island
to
find
food
and
water
and
fishing
the
boat
be
rot
everything
they
try
--
everything
it
be
like
the
worst
storm
of
bad
luck
very
first
winter
for
the
settler
what
be
that
like
the
first
winter
be
pretty
brutal
but
a
far
more
difficult
winter
be
come
up
in
two
year
that
deadly
winter
of
1609
become
know
as
the
starving
time
and
what
be
that
time
for
the
settlers
the
relation
with
the
Indians
start
to
go
sour
and
pretty
fast
in
1609
add
the
colonist
be
more
demand
try
to
get
food
the
food
seller
no
longer
of
--
fo
cellar
be
of
no
we
be
in
the
zmaert
of
the
Fort
where
we
have
find
a
early
kitchen
can
we
go
down
there
yes
let
go
this
be
the
you
be
look
at
the
brick
of
the
this
be
a
cath
that
go
back
further
even
thoughd
this
be
a
kitchen
where
someone
could
be
work
in
1608
by
1609
or
1610
it
be
not
use
as
a
kitchen
a
lot
die
and
only
about
60
survive
dherp
force
to
eat
they
dog
they
horse
and
worse
it
be
you
belief
that
now
we
know
it
be
such
a
desperate
time
that
they
have
to
resort
to
can
bammism
to
survive
exactly
this
be
not
a
this
be
survival
cannibalism
we
know
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
it
take
place
here
in
the
winter
how
do
you
know
we
find
a
level
of
soil
we
find
a
mandible
a
jawbone
we
find
part
--
frag
meanted
cranium
and
we
find
a
tibia
which
be
you
Shin
bone
and
these
belong
to
a
young
English
woman
about
14
year
oe
age
when
she
we
see
the
same
marking
on
she
bone
as
we
have
see
on
the
dog
and
the
horse
which
be
evidence
of
processing
basically
she
be
without
a
doubt
eat
the
struggle
at
Jamestown
wereal
very
real
but
there
be
some
glimmer
of
hope
in
this
newly
form
society
f
obviously
the
first
several
year
in
this
settlement
be
tremendously
hadifficult
what
about
new
life
what
about
child
there
be
woman
and
man
they
start
family
do
not
they
there
be
child
here
pretty
early
Onis
and
some
of
tm
make
it
to
adulthood
the
colony
survive
the
man
who
fight
the
story
of
family
that

unearth
by
piece
together
treasure
under
the
soil
the
fabric
of
we
existence
todayne
discover
by
overturnus
one
stone
at
a
time
to
make
that
discovery
and
really
have
a
idea
of
what
these
folk
go
through
what
kind
of
thought
--
we
do
get
this
connection
with
these

colonist
here
at
Jamestown

they
start
with
the
best
and
worst
in
the
world
of
big
news
it
be
a
year
of
first
I
think
a
lot
of
people
who
predict
a
lot
of
thing
be
wrong
I
can
not
believe
it
be
the
end
of
the
year
already
it
be
be
weird
some
weird
stuff
happen
kind
of
horrifying
in
term
of
some
headline
the
worst
way
to
start
come
in
first
few
day
of
January
with
the
terror
attack
on
the
french
paper
Charlie
Hebdo
add
in
the
attack
on
Paris
later
and
indeed
around
the
world
and
you
get
the
worst
story
of
the
year
the
persistent
plague
of
terrorism
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
be
deal
here
with
a
very
different
beast
something
we
have
not
see
before
something
which
do
not
follow
any
form
of
normal
social
norm
or
even
even
by
the
perversion
of
terr
terrorism
this
be
absolutely
out
of
the
pal
you
feel
hopeless
you
feel
scared
and
all
you
can
do
be
post
a
picture
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
inside
a
peace
sign
and
put
it
on
instagram
what
else
do
you
do
the
official
response
to
Isis
more
than
coalition
air
strike
since
they
begin
last
year
include
one
that
official
say
kill
the
infamous
Jihadi
John
and
the
best
personal
reaction
to
it
all
that
boy
that
Dad
vicious
assault
come
closer
to
home
too
Mass
shooting
rock
a
school
in
Oregon
a
planned
parenthood
clinic
in
Colorado
and
many
other
place
include
San
Bernardino
California
where
a
shooting
at
a
office
gathering
as
the
year
wind
down
reignite
fear
of
domestic
terrorism
any
time
that
you
hear
about
like
a
mass
shooting
whether
it
be
a
school
or
a
church
it
be
like
it
be
really
really
really
sad
because
it
go
to
show
you
that
sometimes
you
be
not
in
control
in
Charleston
South
Carolina
amass
decree
at
a
church
prayer
meeting
strike
many
people
very
hard
but
what
be
so
uplifting
and
amazing
actually
be
I
be
go
to
say
they
faith
in
action
that
congregation
afterward
amazing
grace
how
sweet
the
sound
most
graceful
move
in
the
aftermath
the
relatively
swift
step
by
South
Carolina
to
bow
to
pressure
and
take
the
rebel
flag
off
of
permanent
official
display
that
feel
like
one
of
those
like
the
problem
come
up
we
ban
it
it
be
over
with
and
as
a
society
it
feel
like
we
be
like
next
next
problem
not
exactly
this
year
the
worst
domestic
problem
that
seem
almost
unsolvable
--
racial
tension
hand
up
do
not
shoot
what
we
be
hear
again
and
again
from
the
african-american
community
be
they
do
not
feel
as
if
they
be
be
treat
equally
or
with
the
respect
by
law
enforcement
as
everyone
else
in
Baltimore
the
death
of
a
black
man
in
police
custody
set
off
day
of
unrest
other
case
in
other
place
follow
many
of
they
shocking
and
poll
now
show
almost
half
of
all
Americans
think
race
be
a
big
problem
that
be
a
20-year
high
hand
up
do
not
shoot
and
as
police
inquiry
mount
--
there
need
to
be
more
than
just
lay
people
off
suspend
without
pay
more
than
that
you
know
that
be
not
enough
because
they
need
to
be
make
a
example
out
of
and
they
need
to
fear
the
repercussion
of
treat
people
as
though
they
be
not
human
being
the
worst
backlash
police
officer
seemingly
be
target
shoot
at
and
in
some
case
kill
when
that
happen
I
be
so
afraid
because
if
everyone
rebel
against
the
police
then
who
be
go
to
protect
we
worst
case
of
try
too
hard
to
empathize
the
white
woman
in
Spokane
who
pass
herself
off
as
black
with
a
local
chapter
of
the
NAACP
I
identify
as
black
she
say
I
be
like
there
be
no
way
this
be
real
this
story
be
not
real
they
get
a
woman
to
pose
for
these
picture
this
be
crazy
best
way
to
cool
everyone
off

worst

on
how

the

be
comically
chaotic
this
year
with
the
presidential
race
bring
candidate
fight
at
every
turn
and
a
democratic
process
that
look
more
like
a
demolition
derby
no
one
slam
into
the
headline
harder
than
Donald
Trump
as
he
accelerate
into
the
race
with
explosive
pronouncement
about
mexican
immigrant
they
be
bring
drug
they
be
rapist
--
and
woman
she
want
to
breast
pump
in
front
of
I
and
I
may
have
say
that
be
disgusting
I
may
have

something
else
I
think
it
be
terrible
he
meet
every
challenger
head
on
even
as
pundit
predict
time
and
again
he
could
not
last
get
out
of
here
so
Donald
Trump
have
prove
those
of
we
who
think
we
know
something
about
politics
wrong
every
step
of
the
way
I
think
that
we
be
now
only
begin
to
appreciate
the
anger
and
the
passion
among
the
electorate
which
be
something
that
trump
have
be
able
to
tap
into
meanwhile
fact-checkers
and
comedian
go
wild
this
be
the
year
where
the
Saturday
night
live
skit
just
write
themselves
when
it
come
to
the
politics
it
write
themselves
they
do
not
have
my
talent
my
money
or
especially
my
good
look
unfortunately
the
way
we
elect
we
president
be
not
unlike
the
way
we
create
hit
tv
show
with
a
crowded
republican
field
some
voter
be
unimpressed
I
do
not
care
who
be
polling
better
right
now
we
have
many
month
to
go
this
be
go
to
be
a
very
long
process
and
I
will
tell
you
I
be
go
to
do
a
lot
of
research
before
that
happen
but
I
have
not
even
begin
there
be
just
too
many
people
in
the
playing
field
on
the
democratic
side
Hillary
Clinton
come
in
as
the
front-runner
and
stay
there
thank
you
so
much
even
as
some
in
she
party
rally
around
she
few
challenger
let
make
it
seem
like
we
have
a
lot
of
viable
people
but
the
former
secretary
of
state
still
have
problem
the
only
other
thing
I
can
really
think
of
be
Clinton
Benghazi
--
amid
persistent
question
about
the
Benghazi
attack
come
the
revelation
that
as
secretary
of
state
she
use
a
private
e-mail
server
in
she
home
to
conduct
government
business
she
try
to
laugh
it
off
hey
do
you
wipe
the
server
what
like
with
a
cloth
or
something
but
even
as
she
insist
she
do
nothing
wrong
poll
reveal
as
many
as
60
%
of
voter
do
not
trust
she
part
of
be
a
Clinton
it
seem
be
accept
that
there
be
people
out
there
who
will
never
trust
you
and
might
never
like
you
but
still
be
able
to
or
try
to
get
51
%
of
the
vote
strangely
enough
she
best
defense
come
from
a
challenger
Vermont
Bernie
Sanders
the
american
people
be
sick
and
tired
of
hear
about
you
damn
e-mail
Sanders
also
prove
resilient
enough
to
make
some
Democrats
believe
he
have
a
chance
despite
Clinton
big
lead
Barack
Obama
do
not
nobody
know
who
he
be
so
and
if
he
can
do
it
anybody
can
do
it
I
be
not
surprise
at
all
with
so
many
voter
skeptical
of
the
political
process
and
just
plain
angry
the
biggest
trend
claim
outsider
status
Hillary
like
well
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
lady
and
Chris
Christie
like
well
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
republican
in
a
democratic
state
one
always
hesitate
to
criticize
or
to
comment
in
a
sense
on
a
political
process
when
the
people
be
be
give
the
right
to
speak
but
this
be
extraordinary
I
do
not
even
know
how
many
people
be
run
for
president
what
be
it
like
eight
I
have
no
idea
the
good
part
be
you
have
people
who
have
never
care
about
politics
in
they
life
that
actually
be
watch
the
debate
and
they
care
and
they
be
talk
about
it
it
be
trend
as
the
kid
say
it
be
trend
least
effective
way
to
get
yourself
hear
in
Washington
because
you
just
might
be
shoot
down
fly
a
gyrocopter
to
the
Capitol
in
a
call
for
campaign
finance
reform
most
effective
way
to
get
hear
black
life
matter
hand
up
do
not
shoot
the
group
confront
politician
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
scoring
headline
every
time
some
do
not
like
they
method
but
--
please
black
life
matter
by
and
large
have
be
the
most
peaceful
protest
when
compare
to
some
of
these
other
movement
if
you
catch
my
drift
worst
job
of
convincing
voter
they
be
listen
to
anyone
the
Congress
I
think
Congress
be
Darth
vader
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
Congress
can
do
to
make
itself
more
likable
whether
it
be
a
democratic
congress
or
a
republican
Congress
it
be
just
one
of
those
word
that
Americans
seem
to
think
you
know
it
be
fingernail
on
a
chalkboard
right
now
even
the
speaker
of
the
House
step
down
ZIP-A-DEE-DOO-DAH
Zippity
Yea
my
oh
my
what
a
wonderful
day
John
Boehner
be
so
happy
about
leave
that
job
like
he
be
literally
singing
as
he
walk
up
to
the
podium

a
cornerstone
of
voter
interest
keep
slowly
improve
however
--
wages

up
the
way
many
people
want
people
do
not
feel
like
thing
be
go
great
right
now

that
be
a
problem

compare
to
the
rest
of
the
world
--
the
american
economy

as
the
cleanest
dirty

of
the
xx
in
athletics
as
the
woman
of
USA

the
world
cup
in
soccer
and
be
now
rank
number
one
on
the
planet
what
a
great
year
for
woman
so
you
know
that
you
have
really
nail
it
when
you
get
the
president
to
say
a
bad

this
team
teach
all
of
America
child
that

destroy
almost
everyone
on

just
barely
miss
out
on
a

year
Grand
Slam
however
what
a
fearsome
fearsome
brilliant
athlete
she
be
we
have
not
see
the
best
of
that
woman
I
be
convinced
she
be
one
of
the
best
athlete
--
not
even
female
athlete
just
one
of
the
best
athlete
in
at
least
a
generation
but
maybe
history
and
even
the
biggest
mano
a
mano
contest
be
between
the
unstoppable
force
of
Ronda
Rousey
and
Holm
with
Holm
the

do
not
worry
about
Ronda

she
be
still
a
inspiration
and
I
be
happy
know
that
many
young
girl
out
there
will
get
to
see
Ronda
Rousey
beat
the
living
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
out
of
another
person
again
in
man
sport
the
best
thing
in
football
be
the
New
England
patriots
snatch
the
Super
Bowl
trophy
from
the
seahawks
but
they
also
give
we
the
worst
thing
deflategate
I
mean
the
suggestion
that
the
Patriots
somehow
cheat
on
they
way
to
the
super
bowl
be
something
that
no
new
England
sports
fan
want
to
hear
or
want
to
hear
we
could
not
get
enough
of
it
the
ball
joke
be
all
over
the
place
someone
deflate
the
ball
they
touch
the
ball
Tom
Brady
say
which
ball
he
like
while
the
NFL
sort
out
that
situation
the
league
be
on
track
for
a
record
number
of
penalty
this
year
but
the
worst
hit
come
in
a
high
school
game
when
the
referee
be
tackle
and
worst
rise
trend
the
rapidly
escalate
concern
about
fantasy
football
and
gambling
be
that
the
girl
run
around
you

the
girl
that
run
around
in

tights
and
they
play
football
that
be
not
fantasy
football
in

royal
be
the
best
maul
the
mets
in
the
world
series
in
hockey
the
blackhawks
douse
the
lightning
to
take
the
Stanley
Cup
and
in
basketball
the
golden
state
warrior
crush
the
cavaliers
to
take
the
NBA
trophy
I
will
say
that
I
think
Steph
curry
with
the
Golden
State
warrior
be
one
of
the
most
underappreciated
athlete
of
we
time
the
worst
international

I
be
Milissa
Rehberger
we
begin
with
break
news
we
be
get
new
detail
about
the
fatal
shooting
at
a
bar
in
central
Tel
Aviv
earlier
today
two
people
be
dead
and
eight
be
injure
we
want
to
show
you
new
video
of
the
moment
just
before
a
gunman
open
fire
but
a
warning
this
close
circuit
footage
be
a
bit
graphic
a
man
be
see
pick
out
vegetable
at
the
store
next
door
to
a
bar
that
be
before
he
appear
to
pull
a
weapon
out
of
he
bookbag
and
start
shooting
police
believe
that
this
be
the
gunman
involve
in
this
attack
MSNBC
be
also
get
new
video
of
the
massive
door-to-door
manhunt
currently
under
way
in
Tel
Aviv
a
eyewitness
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
be
share
this
video
with
we
part
of
the
israeli
city
be
seal
off
as
police
search
for
the
suspect
police
be
say
it
be
still
unclear
if
the
shooting
be
a
terrorist
attack
or
not
MSNBC
CAL
Perry
join
we
with
detail
at
least
two
people
dead
more
than
eight
other
wound
this
shooting
now
more
than
four
hour
old
police
still
do
not
have
anyone
in
custody
that
we
know
about
and
those
search
be
still
go
on
in
Tel
Aviv
much
of
the
city
be
still
shut
down
it
be
important
to
remember
this
be
a
Friday
in
Israel
so
the
sort
of
holy
day
in
Judaism
have
take
place
from
Friday
sun
down
to
Saturday
sun
down
as
we
watch
this
video
one
of
the
thing
police
be
try
to
unpack
be
how
the
gunman
get
away
so
quickly
they
reason
for
not
give
motive
the
implication
be
go
to
be
massive
if
this
turn
out
to
have
be
a
terrorist
attack
the
implication
could
be
massive
not
just
for
Palestinians
live
in
the
West
Bank
and
Gaza
but
there
be
always
a
concern
that
something
can
be
isis
inspire
it
be
a
concern
we
have
here
in
the
United
States
and
a
concern
that
israeli
official
have
there
be
a
reason
audio
message
last
week
last
Saturday
by
the
head
of
Isis
Al
Baghdadi
he
specifically
threaten
Israel
while
we
at
NBC
News
can
not
independently
confirm
that
audio
message
we
know
that
israeli
official
be
look
into
that
as
a
potential
motive
it
be
easy
to
assume
that
most
family
would
be
inside
which
could
be
a
good
thing
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
be
there
concern
you
have
hear
that
because
a
gunman
may
be
take
shelter
with
a
family
no
we
do
not
think
so
the
reason
for
that
be
israeli
police
be
say
people
in
Tel
Aviv
can
go
about
they
normal
life
they
be
not
ask
anyone
to
sort
of
shelter
in
place
it
be
also
a
rainy
cold
day
in
Tel
Aviv
that
be
partly
why
you
be
see
empty
street
thank
you
so
much
cal
Perry
join
I
now
be
a
journalist
who
be
near
the
scene
right
now
give
we
some
perspective
where
be
you
and
what
have
you
be
see
and
hear
so
I
be
just
a
few
block
from
the
bar
where
this
attack
occur
and
actually
when
it
happen
earlier
today
I
be
out
to
lunch
at
a
cafe
just
off
of
the
street
where
the
shooting
happen
and
immediately
after
--
first
of
all
earlier
in
the
day
it
be
a
busy
day
in
Tel
Aviv
as
Cal
say
this
be
not
a
workday
friday
be
extremely
busy
on
the
street
of
Tel
Aviv
it
be
a
very
popular
place
to
go
have
a
beer
on
a
Friday
afternoon
so
the
street
be
pack
now
they
be
empty
and
my
friend
who
live
on
the
street
where
the
manhunt
be
go
on
be
see
team
and
security
official
and
civilian
outfits
go
door-to-door
search
apartment
now
my
source
say
they
have
move
outside
of
Tel
Aviv
to
look
for
gunman
but
it
be
a
very
quiet
night
even
relatively
Friday
night
in
Tel
Aviv
be
still
pretty
busy
and
even
in
the
cold
people
be
very
scare
to
go
out
now
because
the
gunman
be
on
the
loose
I
would
imagine
be
you
familiar
with
this
bar
or
one
like
it
for
instance
be
it
a
local
watering
hole
or
be
it
more
for
tourist
I
be
try
to
get
some
sort
of
idea
of
who
might
have
be
target
and
why
yeah
it
be
a
local
hangout
I
have
be
there
popular
bar
on
any
give
Friday

in

firefighter

battle
flame
at
a
high-rise
hotel
as
firework
go
off
just
block
away
investigator
be
still
try
to
determine
the
cause
of
the
fire
we
have
new
image
of
the
interior
of
that
hotel
from
the
Dubai
Media
office
you
can
see
the
extent
of
the
damage
NBC
Chapman
Bell
be
in
London
with
more
what
do
we
know
at
this
point
well
what
we
be
hear
be
from
Dubai
civil
defense
department
that
they
now
have
cool
procedure
still
ongoing
in
this
hotel
where
they
be
able
to
bring
the
flame
under
control
and
they
also
say
a
investigation
be
already
under
way
to
try
to
find
out
what
cause
this
blaze
what
they
be
say
be
that
it
begin
on
the
20th
floor
of
this
65-story
skyscraper
it
be
a
luxury
hotel
and
apartment
and
as
you
say
just
around
the
corner
from
the
Burj
Khalifa
which
be
the
world
tallest
building
and
the
center
point
for
these
firework
the
massive
firework
display
in
Dubai
and
the
building
catch
on
fire
and
as
you
see
burn
wildly
engulf
in
flame
just
hour
before
the
city
be
suppose
to
ring
in
the
new
year
with
they
firework
display
authority
there
be
comfortable
enough
that
firefighter
and
other
emergency
personnel
have
bring
the
flame
under
control
enough
to
continue
on
with
they
firework
display
as
they
do
ring
in
the
new
year
but
today
still
smolder
and
smoking
the
emir
of
Dubai
tweet
that
he
be
proud
of
the
ambulance
service
and
firefighter
and
other
civil
defense
worker
the
way
they
handle
this
as
I
say
a
investigation
be
already
under
way
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
cause
of
this
blaze
be
but
really
almost
overshadow
Dubai
normally
well-known
firework
display
one
that
be
actually
a
world
leader
set
the
world
record
when
they
ring
in
the
year
2014
beat
the
previous
record
in
just
the
first
minute
of
the
six-minute
display
so
a
real
sense
of
pride
for
they
so
they
seem
to
be
very
pleased
that
they
be
able
to
get
this
fire
contain
so
quickly
and
also
only
14
injury
they
say
minor
injury
and
they
also
say
one
moderate
injury
and
one
person
suffer
a
heart
attack
but
amazingly
no
fatality
in
a
really
built-up
area
where
people
be
just
hour
away
from
watch
this
firework
display
so
it
be
really
amazing
that
there
be
no
fatality
as
of
yet
record
in
this
massive
fire
it
definitely
be
Chapman
we
be
also
get
word
of
a
incident
in
southeastern
France
at
this
hour
apparently
soldier
be
protect
a
mosque
what
can
you
tell
we
about
that
that
be
right
well
under
France
state
of
emergency
over
the
holiday
they
have
say
that
soldier
and
police
would
be
protect
house
of
worship
church
mosque
synagogue
and
that
appear
to
be
what
these
four
soldier
be
do
and
a
car
the
police
department
there
say
they
believe
target
the
soldier
not
the
mosque
drive
into
these
police
officer
slightly
injure
they
they
do
fire
on
this
vehicle
empty
they
clip
we
hear
from
they
firearm
injure
the
driver
of
the
vehicle
he
be
now
in
police
custody
at
a
hospital
and
they
be
wait
to
interrogate
he
but
as
of
now
they
think
the
soldier
be
in
fact
the
target
of
this
driver
Chapman
Bell
thank
you
very
much
we
want
to
go
back
to
that
fire
in
Dubai
and
the
investigation
let
bring
in
former
New
York
City
Fire
Commissioner
who
join
I
by
phone
thank
you
very
much
for
be
with
we
what
be
you
opinion
on
how
firefighter
handle
all
of
this
well
it
look
like
they
do
a
outstanding
job
very
difficult
fire
for
they
because
you
can
not
put
a
fire
outside
go
up
30
40
story
out
very
easily
you
know
when
you
take
a
line
into
one
particular
room
or
a
larger
area
you
get
enough
people
and
you
get
enough
water
and
you
put
it
out
but
to
get
water
up
the
side
of
a
building
in
that
situation
very
very
difficult
and
then
they
be
concern
of
course
more
concerned
with
people
that
might
be
trap
on
the
inside
of
the
building
and
you
know
worried
about
that
that
be
where
you
real
concern
would
be
not
the
damage
to
the
building
but
the
possibility
that
people
could
be
overcome
by
smoke
or
trap
the
big
question
right
now
be
obviously
what
cause
this
what
do
investigator
look
for
and
what
be
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
that
we
should
expect
the
investigation
to
take
well
the
early
report
be
that
it
start
with
a
curtain
on
the
20th
floor
which
do
not
really
make
sense
that
a
curtain
on
a
interior
apartment
could
cause
enough
fire
or
provide
enough
fuel
to
create
that
kind
of
a
situation
on
the
outside
of
the
building
there
be
also
report
of
the
outside
of
the
structure
be
clothe
with
a
aluminum
product
that
inside
of
it
be
plastic
and
that
that
be
what
be
provide
the
fuel
for
go
up
the
side
of
the
building
that
make
sense
and
there
be
report
of
horrible
fume
outside
the
whole
area
which
would
give
you
the
sense
the
feeling
or
it
would
be
the
plastic
inside
that
aluminum
but
to
provide
that
much
fire
to
create
that
much
you
know
intensity
so
fast
that
be
very
quick
and
it
burn
a
long
time
so
the
fuel
provide
by
the
side
of
the
building
be
probably
what
cause
that
fire
to
burn
so
long
and
if
it
get
into
individual
apartment
through
the
glass
breaking
or
melting
and
the
fire
get
inside
and
sprinkler
put
the
fire
out
everything
seem
to
work
except
for
that
product
if
that
be
the
case
on
the
outside
of
the
building
but
to
say
that
it
be
cause
by
a
curtain
do
not
make
sense
to
I
look
like
it
be
more
from
maybe
something
on
that
deck
that
look
like
it
be
20
floor
up
or
so
maybe
there
be
other
reason
that
would
have
cause
it
what
be
you
opinion
on
the
fact
that
they
go
ahead
with
they
firework
display
they
kind
of
get
beat
up
on
social
media
and
the
image
of
it
really
be
surreal
we
just
hear
NBC
Chapman
Bell
explain
that
Dubai
be
very
proud
of
its
firework
but
what
be
you
opinion
on
they
decision
to
go
ahead
with
that
display
while
this
huge
inferno
be
burn
well
they
make
a
tough
decision
and
they
get
away
with
it
because
there
be
no
other
incident
and
it
be
not
a
secondary
event
that
be
cause
by
the
firework
so
in
that
regard
they
be
fortunate
it
be
a
very
big
deal
to
they
they
be
very
proud
they
want
to
show
that
they
could
handle
both
situation
at
the
same
time
the
fire
be
declare
under
control
before
they
start
the
firework
I
do
not
know
exactly
what
they
consider
under
control
it
look
to
we
watch
it
like
there
be
a
awful
lot
of
fire
still
go
on
in
the
individual
room
but
it
look
like
that
hotel
or
residence
whatever
the
percentage
of
room
be
be
pretty
vacant
I
do
not
think
--
it
be
not
a
full
hotel
with
celebrant
there
for
the
new
year
celebration
look
like
it
be
a
lot
of
high
end
condominium
thing
like
that
that
maybe
be
vacant
so
maybe
the
people
run
the
hotel
know
that
the
load
be
light
inside
the
hotel
that
the
search
be
not
go
to
be
as
extensive
necessary
for
the
firefighter
so
they
could
handle
it
and
I
think
when
the
emergency
people
the
emergency
management
people
in
the
area
make
--
get
all
the
information
more
information
than
we
have
watch
it
they
make
a
decision
and
fortunately
it
be
the
right
decision
for
they
last
night
because
there
be
no
other
incident
they
do
a
good
job
I
think
they
be
fortunate
that
so
many
people
be
there
for
the
firework
display
that
help
they
move
the
people
who
be
run
away
from
the
danger
at
the
fire
that
the
debris
come
off
that
building
be
go
one
direction
they
be
push
people
in
the
other
direction
so
all
in
all
it
work
out
for
they
with
a
very
very
small
amount
of
injury

those
number

this
be
the
pursuit
of
perfection
it
be
the
final
full
year
of
president
Obama
term
in
office
and
he
be
signal
that
gun
control
reform
be
a
major
item
leave
on
he
to-do
list
the

use
he
weekly
address
this
morning
to
explain
we
can
no
longer
quote
afford
to
sit
around

do
nothing
ten
of

of
we

have
be
mow
down

ten
of
thousand
each
time
we
be
tell
that
common
sense
reform
like
background
check
might
not
have
stop
the
last
massacre
or
the
one
before
that
so
we
should
not
do
anything
we
know
we
can

act

NBC
Ron
Allen
be
with
the
president
in
Hawaii
and
here
on
set
be
Philip
bump
of
the
Washington
Post
thank
you
both
for
be
here
Ron
what
be
the
president
plan
I
understand
he
be
go
to
meet
with
attorney
general
Loretta
Lynch
on
Monday
correct
exactly
but
this
be
something
that
be
be
in
the
work
for
many
week
if
not
month
the
president
be
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
use
he
executive
authority
to
try
and
bring
about
what
he
call
common
sense
gun
law
gun
safety
law
you
know
the
Congress
have
be
adamant
about
not
do
anything
in
this
area
and
be
still
adamant
about
not
do
anything
in
this
area
and
the
president
do
not
have
the
vote
to
change
that
so
he
be
try
to
use
he
own
the
power
of
he
own
office
to
try
and
do
something
and
the
focus
seem
to
be
on
this
issue
of
background
check
a
lot
of
gun
be
sell
at
gun
show
and
online
by
low
volume
gun
dealer
you
would
call
they
and
they
be
not
subject
they
do
not
subject
the
buyer
to
background
check
that
be
one
area
the
president
we
think
be
go
to
focus
on
another
area
be
this
what
we
have
be
hear
about
since
Paris
and
San
Bernardino
the
so-called
no-fly
no
buy
list
these
be
people
who
be
on
a
terrorist
watch
list
or
no-fly
list
they
be
not
allow
to
board
a
airplane
but
be
still
allow
to
purchase
gun
so
that
be
another
loophole
the
president
be
try
to
target
we
believe
the
bottom
line
be
that
the
president
have
say
on
many
occasion
that
this
be
the
most
frustrating
the
most
disappointing
aspect
of
he
administration
he
inability
to
pass
what
he
call
common
sense
gun
safety
law
to
do
something
about
these
mass
shooting
that
happen
in
the
United
States
on
a
regular
basis
he
meet
with
these
family
he
get
letter
every
day
from
grieve
family
and
when
you
hear
he
talk
about
this
you
can
see
it
have
emotionally
affect
he
and
he
really
want
to
do
something
about
it
so
that
be
he
goal
one
of
he
big
goal
during
the
final
year
in
office
what
about
Congress
give
all
the
mass
shooting
we
have
have
even
just
in
2015
there
have
be
way
too
many
as
we
look
back
on
that
do
you
see
Congress
take
action
as
well
no
Congress
try
to
pass
in
the
wake
of
the
Sandy
hook
shooting
in
2012
Congress
move
forward
on
some
issue
include
the
background
check
legislation
that
be
just
mention
it
do
not
get
out
of
the
Senate
four
Democrats
and
Harry
Reid
for
procedural
reason
vote
against
that
measure
Congress
will
not
pass
new
legislation
you
hear
the
president
talk
about
how
the
vast
majority
of
Americans
support
expand
background
check
but
the
majority
of
Americans
also
oppose
new
gun
control
measure
it
will
be
very
easy
for
opponent
of
what
the
president
be
try
to
do
to
spin
this
as
something
which
Americans
say
they
do
not
want
the
president
will
give
he
final
state
of
the
union
address
on
January
12th
we
be
tell
to
expect
a
unconventional
speech
what
do
that
mean
it
mean
that
it
will
not
be
a
laundry
list
of
thing
he
want
Congress
to
do
I
think
one
of
the
theme
of
this
presidency
have
be
that
Congress
be
not
go
to
do
anything
so
I
be
go
to
do
what
I
can
use
my
own
the
authority
of
my
office
I
think
the
president
go
to
talk
about
accomplishment
he
be
have
over
the
past
year
and
what
he
still
want
to
do
there
be
issue
like
gun
legislation
gun
control
that
be
go
to
be
prominent
he
will
talk
about
the
trade
bill
that
be
pend
before
Congress
the
trans-pacific
partnership
agreement
with
about
a
dozen
asian
nation
that
be
a
sweeping
trade
agreement
that
he
want
the
Congress
to
pass
he
be
go
to
talk
about
the
open
up
to
Cuba
the
Iran
nuclear
deal
Guantanamo
Bay
be
something
else
that
be
out
there
he
be
say
he
want
to
close
that
prison
and
there
be
still
about
100
or
so
detainee
there
what
be
he
go
to
do
about
that
he
will
talk
about
keep
the
economy
strong
and
create
more
opportunity
for
the
middle
class
which
have
be
a
theme
of
he
presidency
I
think
the
state
of
the
union
be
go
to
be
if
you
will
part
victory
lap
part
unfinished
business
but
as
he
say
this
year-end
press
conference
he
will
quote
leave
it
all
on
the
field
go
out
during
the
final
year
of
he
office
he
be
go
to
be
very
engage
and
of
course
another
big
goal
be
to
get
a
Democrat
elect
to
follow
he
into
the
White
House
he
intend
to
be
out
there
on
the
campaign
trail
I
think
we
will
hear
a
lot
about
what
the
president
want
to
do
and
a
lot
of
that
be
go
to
be
what
he
be
go
to
try
to
do
how
he
will
use
the
bully
pulpit
of
the
presidency
go
forward
because
again
he
do
not
expect
Congress
to
do
much
so
he
be
go
to
do
what
he
can
on
he
own
I
think
Ron
thank
you
Philip
on
the
subject
of
election
year
and
the
president
final
term
in
office
how
do
you
see
he
go
forward
do
you
think
he
will
slow
down
he
agenda
to
make
room
for
the
democratic
nominee
and
focus
on
that
or
do
you
see
he
go
full
steam
ahead
with
he
own
agenda
I
have
to
anticipate
see
what
he
do
in
2015
which
be
very
much
full
steam
ahead
he
be
pledge
that
he
state
of
the
union
will
be
somewhat
different
I
think
he
will
target
this
political
chasm
between
the
White
House
and
Capitol
Hill
I
think
he
will
focus
on
that
the
next
year
I
do
not
see
president
Obama
as
someone
who
will
spend
the
next
year
do
what
he
can
to
with
hold
he
own
agenda
on
behalf
of
the
democratic
party
I
think
he
will
push
hard
particularly
if
it
be
a
close
race
and
it
be
not
guarantee
the
next
president
will
be
a
democrat
I
think
that
will
provide
more
incentive
to
he
to
do
what
he
can
I
think
we
be
already
see
right
now
that
president
Obama
be
say
to
heck
with
Congress
I
be
go
to
do
what
I
need
to
do
and
what
I
think
be
right
I
think
that
will
be
the
theme
for
the
next
12
month
okay

as
well
as

all
who
have

she
exceptional
talent
I
be
join
on
set
by
Reverend
Al
Sharpton
First
of
all
my
condolence
I
understand
you
be
friend
with
she
I
do
get
to
know
she
not
as
well
as
some
of
the
other
I
be
very
close
with
James
Brown
he
be
like
a
father
to
I
so
I
would
run
into
a
lot
and
Michael
Jackson
and
I
work
together
I
think
what
be
striking
to
I
about
she
I
remember
one
night
we
be
in
California
talk
and
she
father
be
this
historic
figure
Nat
King
Cole
and
you
always
assume
that
when
someone
who
be
that
big
and
they
child
start
sing
they
would
get
break
because
of
they
she
make
it
on
she
own
talent
she
have
a
phenomenal
voice
a
phenomenal
style
and
I
think
that
night
she
be
say
to
I
that
she
always
feel
the
pressure
of
want
to
prove
that
she
be
able
to
ascend
to
where
she
do
not
because
she
be
nat
king
Cole
daughter
but
because
of
she
own
talent
which
put
add
pressure
on
she
and
it
be
the
reverse
of
a
lot
of
people
because
they
have
a
sense
of
entitlement
she
do
not
have
a
sense
of
entitlement
she
have
a
sense
of
challenge
and
always
respect
that
about
she
I
feel
that
she
try
to
perfect
she
art
she
be
very
very
good
I
understand
that
a
lot
of
people
probably
be
not
as
aware
of
she
career
before
that
famous
duet
that
she
do
with
she
late
father
I
know
that
be
how
I
be
mostly
introduce
to
she
talent
and
I
think
it
be
the
most
beautiful
thing
I
have
ever
hear
I
remember
it
very
clearly
be
that
do
as
a
way
maybe
to
feel
closer
to
he
I
think
that
I
be
guess
that
it
probably
be
I
think
it
be
she
embrace
the
legacy
of
she
father
I
think
she
have
come
to
term
with
what
I
say
the
one
long
conversation
I
have
with
she
in
California
that
she
be
now
comfortable
she
have
make
it
on
she
own
and
could
do
that
and
I
think
it
be
something
that
go
huge
for
she
across
all
genre
but
she
be
already
in
the
and
in
the
have
do
hit
and
win
grammys
I
use
to
tease
she
with
some
of
the
hit
she
do
in
the
because
I
be
just
slightly
younger
than
she
I
use
to
tease
she
and
say
you
know
all
of
we
grow
up
say
you
be
sing
to
we
so
she
be
well-established
in
certain
field
of
music
but
I
think
that
video
that
she
do
with
she
father
I
think
really
bring
she
to
a
whole
other
level
and
a
new
introduction
to
the
world
music
market
she
have
actually
do
a
duet
live
with
she
father
when
she
be
a
little
girl
6
I
believe
start
out
at
such
a
early
age
be
it
always
she
intention
to
be
a
performer
my
understanding
be
she
grow
up
want
to
perform
grow
up
feeling
that
that
be
a
call
and
she
have
the
gift
if
you
hear
she
sing
you
know
no
one
be
do
she
a
favor
no
one
cut
she
a
break
she
could
really
sing
and
it
also
again
put
that
pressure
on
she
that
she
want
to
live
up
to
the
expectation
she
do
not
feel
that
she
could
just
sit
back
and
rest
on
she
laurel
because
she
be
Nat
King
Cole
she
make
Natalie
Cole
a
star
in
she
own
right
she
deserve
that
credit
give
all
of
she
incredible
talent
and
she
personal
struggle
weave
all
together
how
will
she
be
remember
I
think
she
will
be
remember
as
a
velvet
voice
at
a
time
that
many
people
be
look
for
someone
that
could
sing
in
she
era
and
she
do
that
she
do
it
majestically
yes
she
have
challenge
yes
she
have
issue
but
she
sing
above
she
issue
and
give
all
of
we
a
lot
of
good
music

Sharpton

hour

the
democratic
front-runner
have
raise
$
55
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
$
37
million
for
she
own
campaign
and
another
$
18
million
for
national
and
state
democratic
party
join
I
from
Washington
Bob
Frankin
syndicate

columnist
and
anne
Gearan

the
the
Washington
post
Anne
$
55
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
for
Clinton
can
you
put
those
number
into
context
for
we
sure
this
be
a
big
number
$
18
million
of
it
be
for
use
in
the
general
election
for
she
for
other
Democrats
this
be
the
first
time
since
announce
for
president
in
April
that
she
have
be
raise
money
for
the
general
election
she
campaign
have
try
to
make
the
point
that
they
do
have
a
primary
fight
on
they
hand
and
they
want
to
raise
money
initially
and
specifically
for
the
primary
they
obviously
sort
of
let
they
belt
out
a
notch
or
two
here
in
the
final
quarter
feel
that
they
have
the
leeway
to
go
ahead
and
start
raise
money
for
the
general
election
and
do
so
$
37
million
in
primary
money
be
a
lot
for
one
quarter
it
help
she
set
a
record
for
have
raise
the
most
of
any
non-incumbent
in
a
non-election
year
couple
of
caveat
there
but
it
be
a
important
benchmark
basically
mean
she
do
as
a
non-incumbent
what
president
Obama
do
as
a
incumbent
we
have
a
new
batch
of
Hillary
Clinton
e-mail
yesterday
include
one
that
mention
that
viral
image
of
secretary
Clinton
check
she
blackberry
on
a
plane
what
do
the
e-mail
exchange
tell
we
well
the
e-mail
exchange
tell
we
that
there
be
a
little
bit
of
a
sense
of
humor
that
go
into
some
of
these
e-mail
once
that
viral
image
get
out
there
of
course
one
of
the
people
who
be
respond
to
she
tell
she
that
she
look
cute
well
this
be
go
to
be
the
next
president
of
the
United
States
and
so
now
we
know
that
at
least
one
of
the
people
who
work
with
she
think
she
can
look
cute
there
be
also
this
one
a
elaborate
flow
chart
of
who
could
ride
in
the
secretary
limo
with
she
what
be
you
thought
on
that
okay
this
be
my
absolute
favorite
one
it
be
hilarious
the
guy
who
write
it
be
a
long-time
Washington
figure
he
be
famous
for
have
a
mercurial
temper
but
also
for
be
fabulously
funny
it
be
only
partly
in
jest
it
be
a
very
specific
flow
chart
of
when
certain
condition
apply
who
get
to
ride
in
the
limousine
with
the
boss
he
put
himself
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
flow
chart
and
basically
if
there
be
room
for
he
he
could
ride
in
it
but
he
say
if
she
be
already
presumptively
in
the
car
should
he
stay
yes
he
vote
for
himself
that
he
should
be
able
to
stay
one
other
thing
that
I
would
point
out
be
that
one
of
the
standard
for
whether
you
get
to
ride
in
the
limousine
be
whether
you
be
boring
or
not
right
when
travel
on
foreign
trip
if
the
ambassador
for
that
particular
country
be
tolerable
then
the
ambassador
get
to
ride
with
she
I
also
want
to
ask
you
on
a
different
subject
about
Ben
Carson
we
know
now
that
five
staffer
with
Ben
Carson
struggle
presidential
campaign
have
resign
include
he
campaign
manager
and
communication
director
in
a
statement
Carson
say
and
I
be
quote
here
as
we
enter
a
new
phase
of
the
campaign
cycle
it
be
necessary
to
invigorate
my
campaign
with
a
strategy
that
more
aggressively
share
my
vision
and
world
view
with
the
american
people
Bob
be
this
a
standard
campaign
shakeup
or
be
this
something
different
well
this
be
a
little
bit
different
we
be
talk
about
enter
a
new
phase
to
use
he
word
30
day
before
the
first
major
major
campaign
event
one
in
which
he
be
go
to
have
to
perform
well
because
he
constituency
be
there
he
base
be
there
the
evangelical
who
have
provide
so
much
of
he
support
and
now
he
be
totally
shake
thing
up
he
be
put
in
somebody
to
be
perfectly
honest
a
retired
general
who
be
not
at
all
test
so
this
be
go
to
be
speak
of
test
this
be
go
to
be
a
big
one
to
see
if
he
can
quickly
gain
traction
Bill
Clinton
be
back
on
the
campaign
trail
for
he
wife
on
Monday
it
be
a
solo
event
will
this
work
for
she
in
the
main
yes
he
be
already
be
out
there
raise
a
lot
of
money
for
she
he
be
a
proven
winner
with
democratic
audience
he
draw
big
crowd
he
bring
in
a
lot
of
money
now
they
be
try
to
turn
that
to
open
election
event
in
the
past
he
be
be
a
big
draw
for
those
as
well
there
be
a
obvious
down
side
he
be
know
to
sometimes
say
thing
that
at
least
in
the
last
campaign
be
not
totally
part
of
the
script
they
be
certainly
hope
that
that
do
not
happen
again
and
then
in
the
context
of
Donald
Trump
recent
attack
on
bill
Clinton
that
also
sort
of
give
that
whole
argument
that
Donald
Trump
have
be
make
about
bill
Clinton
past
allegation
of
sexual
misconduct
a
little
greater
altitude
than
the
campaign
would
like
it
to
have
you
know
I
think
that
we
would
go
through
this
entire
discussion
without
say
the
word
Donald
Trump
but
Anne
--
I
be
so
sorry
yeah
good
luck
with
that
Bob
thank
yous
to
both
of
you
NASA
be
project
that
this
year
El
Nino
weather
system
could
be
the
worst
one
ever
what
that
mean
for
2016
up
next
some
call
it
give
back
we
call
it
share
the
love
during
we
share
the
love
event
get
a
new
Subaru

we
will
donate
$
250
to

in
need
bring
we
total
donation
to
over
sixty-five
million
dollar
and
bring
love
where
it
be
need
most
love
it
be
what
make
a
Subaru
a
Subaru
warning
be
come
from
across
the
globe
that
this
year
El
Nino
weather
system
could
be
the
worst
ever
the
OXFAM
aid
agency
say
people
worldwide
who
may
need
food
and
humanitarian
assistance
could
be
in
the
ten
of
million
back
here
at
home
despite
the
devastating
storm
across
the
season
NASA
be
forecast
the
worst
be
yet
to
come
they
say
El
knee
know
cause
quote
weather
chaos
to
discuss
this
Michael
Mann
professor
at
Penn
State
University
and
author
of
dire
prediction
understand
climate
change
Michael
how
do
you
think
the
extreme
of
the
storm
this
last
month
change
public
opinion
possibly
on
climate
change
well
you
know
we
be
see
unprecedented
weather
around
the
and
the
world
and
part
of
it
be
due
to
El
Nino
and
the
strongest
we
have
ever
see
in
what
just
finish
up
as
the
warmest
year
we
have
ever
see
that
be
due
to
climate
change
climate
change
be
play
a
role
here
and
no
longer
play
a
subtle
role
we
be
see
the
impact
of
climate
change
in
increasingly
more
devastating
weather
event
the
flooding
we
have
see
the
extreme
warmth
in
other
area
and
flooding
in
the
UK
we
be
see
the
impact
of
climate
change
now
with
we
two
--
with
we
two
eye
what
do
you
make
of
the
climate
change
agreement
president
Obama
call
it
the
most
ambitious
in
history
but
critic
say
the
enforcement
mechanism
be
weak
yeah
well
you
know
you
have
to
sort
of
crawl
before
you
can
walk
I
think
it
be
a
important
foot
in
the
door
it
put
in
place
a
framework
for
bring
down
we
carbon
emission
that
we
can
build
on
in
the
year
ahead
and
get
to
where
we
need
to
be
so
that
agreement
alone
be
not
go
to
cut
global
carbon
emission
enough
to
avoid
dangerous
warming
of
the
globe
but
it
get
we
about
halfway
where
we
would
otherwise
be
head
to
where
we
need
to
be
and
that
be
something
we
can
build
on
put
in
place
a
framework
to
build
on
in
the
year
ahead
I
be
cautious
by
optimistic
it
signal
the
beginning
of
a
comprehensive
effort
to
tackle
the
problem
of
climate
change
do
you
agroo
with
the
people
say
this
could
be
the
worst
El
Nino
we
have
ever
have
yeah
in
fact
if
you
just
look
at
the
raw
number
the
temperature
of
the
ocean
in
the
eastern
tropical
Pacific
right
now
be
the
highest
they
have
ever
be
they
warm
up
during
a
El
Nino
event
but
right
now
they
have
warm
up
more
than
they
have
ever
warm
up
before
and
this
be
by
that
pressure
the
biggest
El
Nino
on
record
and
global
warming
be
part
of
it
the
fact
that
the
world
ocean
be
warmer
than
they
have
ever
be
be
part
of
why
we
be
see
such
warmth
in
that
region
of
the
ocean
and
we
know
that
when
that
region
the
eastern
tropical
Pacific
get
warm
enough
it
impact
global
weather
pattern
around
the
world
and
what
we
be
see
to
some
extent
be
effect
of
El
Nino
but
it
be
be
super
charge
by
climate
change
you
book
be
dire
prediction
take
we
through
everything
the
public
can
not
see
that
make
it
the
climate
change
make
a
huge
difference
in
yeah
well
what
we
can
not
see
I
I
the
impact
of
climate
change
be
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
which
be
to
say
that
once
the
effect
of
climate
change
become
this
apparent
become
this
visible
to
we
it
mean
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
climate
change
now
that
be
baked
in
that
we
have
not
even
see
yet
a
whole
lot
of
climate
change
impact
that
be
go
to
get
worse
as
the
global
continue
to
warm
some
amount
just
in
response
to
the
greenhouse
gas
we
have
already
pump
into
the
atmosphere
so
you
know
think
of
the
climate
system
think
of
the
global
climate
as
a
ocean
tanker
you
Slam
on
the
brake
you
do
not
come
to
a
stop
immediately
it
be
go
to
take
some
time
to
come
to
a
stop
and
that
be
why
we
have
to
bring
we
emission
down
so
dramatically
in
the
year
ahead
because
we
do
not
want
to
bake
in
even
more
dangerous
climate
change
it
be
very
strange
Christmas
here
in
New
York
City
where
we
be
base
and
people
wear
flip
flop
and
usually
wear
snow
boot
so
what
other
kind
of
weird
weather
pattern
can
we
be
expect
in
the
month
ahead
well
we
can
expect
to
see
unusual
warmth
over
a
large
part
of
the
the
northern
half
of
the
be
typically
warmer
during
a
El
Nino
year
and
when
unusual
right
now
be
see
warm
in
place
that
do
not
usually
see
extra
warmth
from
El
Nino
the
southeastern
be
unusually
warm
and
very
warm
air
in
the
south
mix
with
the
colder
air
mass
from
the
north
be
give
we
this
unusual
tornado
activity
and
part
of
that
warmth
and
part
of
the
energy
in
the
atmosphere
that
be
give
we
all
this
extreme
weather
be
due
to
the
effect
of
climate
change
put
more
moisture
in
the
atmosphere
more
energy
in
the
atmosphere
to
generate
the
sort
of
storm
we
be
see
okay
we
will
have
to
leave
it
there

if

to
describe
prison
life
in
a
three-letter
text
it

WTF
but

what
you
think
it
do
sorry
mom
it
stand
for
workout
tattoo
I
get
a
tattoo
on
my
pants
the
most
painful
one
I
would
probably
have
to
say
would
be
the
one
I
get
in
the
middle
of
my
armpit
and
food
we
be
not
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
animal
I
do
not
think
a
dog
would
eat
that
this
be
the
jungle
if
you
want
to
eat
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
hey
Yo
listen
it
be
go
down
just
like
this
you
never
know
when
it
be
go
to
pay
to
be
the
stronger
man
you
never
know
when
you
be
go
to
get
into
a
melee
in
here
there
be
no
room
for
slouch
to
survive
behind
bar
a
inmate
really
have
to
display
strength
over
the
year
we
have
see
some
impose
inmate
who
be
either
through
they
lifting
or
through
they
exercise
regimen
look
like
they
can
tear
you
apart
other
inmate
survive
through
they
intelligence
or
through
they
self-confidence
because
the
bottom
line
be
you
have
to
be
strong
to
survive
you
be
either
predator
or
prey
we
have
meet
plenty
of
inmate
eager
to
prove
they
be
anything
but
prey
tell
they
the
beach
be
that
way
right
the
beach
be
that
way
right
the
way
they
achieve
those
result
vary
oh
that
be
all
right
though
I
could
not
get
that
I
know
the
facility
and
equipment
available
at
the
maximum
security
prison
and
jail
we
visit
vary
widely
from
state
to
state
from
county
to
county
some
come
with
modern
gym
and
free
weight
while
other
provide
only
the
most
basic
equipment
often
a
workout
be
only
as
good
as
the
inmate
creativity
some
of
the
exercise
that
they
do
be
pretty
ingenious
pushup
with
they
cellmate
on
they
back
it
be
like
ride
a
bull
different
exercise
that
include
they
cellmate
hand
stand
pushup
I
have
see
but
really
the
creativity
what
kind
of
thing
that
they
be
able
to
achieve
with
so
little
the
different
position
that
they
can
get
into
in
these
little
cell
to
get
multiple
exercise
it
be
all
pretty
interesting
at
the
Orange
County
jail
we
cover
the
story
of
inmate
Jeremy
Bowles
whose
sweaty
workout
routine
leave
he
cell
window
cover
in
condensation
can
you
see
I
yeah
and
sure
enough
he
wipe
the
steam
away
and
it
make
a
dynamic
shot
Bowles
later
invite
director
of
Photography
Brian
Kelly
to
experience
mattress
curling
one
of
he
improvise
in-cell
workout
stick
you
ass
out
like
you
be
take
a
squat
guarantee
that
will
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
you
up
quick
it
be
heavy
yeah
you
feel
it
oh
yeah
my
arm
be
bigger
than
he
look
at
the
gun
it
be
as
if
I
be
do
a
barbell
curl
I
do
not
know
what
the
weight
be
but
there
be
some
resistance
there
and
it
be
a
effective
exercise
for
these
guy
to
actually
work
they
biceps
it
be
great
I
be
go
to
go
back
to
work
while
prison
be
full
of
male
inmate
sweat
and
grunt
through
they
workout
we
have
notice
many
female
inmate
take
a
more
relax
approach
to
fitness
by
far
male
inmate
work
out
much
more
than
female
inmate
it
be
--
it
be
very
rare
to
see
a
male
inmate
that
do
not
work
out
just
like
it
be
kind
of
rare
to
see
a
female
inmate
that
work
out
a
lot
but
there
be
exception
and
that
be
all
I
all
day
long
this
be
a
cage
fighter
right
here
well
not
anymore
I
get
a
felony
now
but
yeah
inside
the
famous
tent
city
housing
complex
at
the
Maricopa
County
jail
in
Phoenix
Arizona
we
find
one
group
of
young
woman
determine
to
tackle
a
common
problem
ready
set
and
one
two
three
just
like
freshman
in
college
dorm
many
new
inmate
put
on
extra
pound
we
do
not
want
to
get
fat
from
the
bread
we
want
to
fit
into
size
one
again
healthy
body
fit
a
healthy
mind
right
we
walk
lap
around
the
yard
we
do
squat
push-up
push-up
and
everything
we
just
do
ten
we
do
ten
I
do
eleven
the
woman
also
have
a
few
unconventional
routine
they
develop
inside
they
tent
include
something
akin
to
drive
a
18-wheeler
this
be
ridiculous
I
see
the
lady
in
the
tent
actually
do
a
lot
of
exercise
plyometric
and
calisthenics
with
not
much
equipment
kind
of
make
do
with
what
they
get
but
at
one
point
I
think
maybe
they
be
perhaps
put
I
on
because
they
show
I
this
workout
where
they
be
pretend
to
drive
a
big
truck
I
could
not
see
how
that
be
go
to
help
they
stay
in
shape
during
they
time
on
the
inside
while
many
woman
gain
weight
from
the
predominantly
starchy
food
serve
in
jail
Dee
Dee
Moore
who
we
meet
at
the
Hillsboro
County
jail
in
Tampa
Florida
prove
to
be
a
exception
I
know
when
you
first
come
in
you
be
weigh
about
210
pound
uh-huh

weigh
250
when
I
first
--
250

I
have
lose
100
pound
since
I
have
be
here
Moore
who
be
await
trial
in
a
high-profile
murder
case
to
which
she
have
plead
not
guilty
attribute
she
weight
loss
to
a
distinct
dislike
of
jail
food
and
she
in-cell
workout
routine
I
run
I
run
in
place
I
do
it
for
30
minute
to
a
hour
I
do
leg
lift
I
do
the
six
inch
I
do
scissors
I
do
the
push-up
the
sit-up
the
jump
jack
this
be
the
biggest
loser
contest
and
I
get
the
public
humiliation
to
go
along
with
it
but
now
I
be
skinny
come
up
some
of
the
wildest
tattoo
you
have
ever
see
get
that
piece
on
camera
baby
show
off
you
work
son
sometimes
shooting
inside
a
prison
or
jail
be
a
bit
like

be
everywhere

look
and
cross
all
line
of
gender
race
and
age
every
day
you
come
into
correction

see
something
different
that
you
think

eyeball
get
some
nails

be
pry
open
at
different
angle
the
tattoo
on
my
chest
be
a
concrete
jungle
it
really
be
like
a
run
up
in
the
jungle
because
you
never
know
what
be
go
to
happen
I
think
tattoo
be
extremely
important
to
most
inmate
they
be
history
book
of
sort
place
that
they
have
be
thing
they
have
be
through
relationship
you
name
it

be
a
tattoo
that
signify
any
one
of
those
thing
and
brilliant
tattoo
display
be
not
limit
to
inmate
we
have
meet
some
correctional
staff
with
plenty
of
they
own
ink
tell
I
about
you
ink
you
have
get
quite
a
lot
of
art
on
you
my
tattoo
be
personal
preference
most
of
they
be
religious
it
be
just
something
I
like
it
be
from
a
painting
of
Michael
and
it
be
get
a
catholic
sacred
heart
on
there
some
latin
writing
for
my
grandmother
a
little
greek
god
on
the
back
which
be
my
son
greek
birth
God
do
the
inmate
comment
on
you
art
occasionally
a
lot
of
they
look
other
than
that
the
inmate
do
not
really
talk
to
we
a
whole
lot
unless
they
need
something

inmate
also
bear
religious
tattoo
--
on
my
back
I
have
get
my
cross
God
watch
my
back
every
day

how
I

lot
of
what
we
see
represent
neighborhood
gang
membership
or
other
affiliation
why
do
you
get
a
swastika
on
you
forehead
I
would
not
say
I
be
a
real
racist
type
of
person
it
be
just
prison
be
a
lot
of
political
stuff
while
I
be
in
here
it
be
either
over
here
or
you
be
over
here
I
be
right
with
my
race
if
that
be
what
you
could
say
the
idea
of
my
race
it
be
something
else
ten
swirl
with
three
dot
in
the
center
represent
13
it
be
protection
under
the
mexican
mafia
you
put
these
tattoo
on
you
represent
who
you
represent
this
be
my
neighborhood
719
everyone
get
that
you
know
the
area
code
where
they
be
from
I
be
from
the
east
side
I
be
from
the
west
side
who
give
a
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
East
side
west
side
do
not
hell
they
be
happy
now
that
you
be
go
so
why
be
you
here
try
to
represent
you
be
not
represent
nothing
but
yourself
when
it
come
to
tattoo
the
beauty
be
truly
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
I
do
not
often
critique
inmate
tattoo
but
in
the
case
of
Ronnie
Tye
when
he
show
I
he
Hitler
Tattoo
I
think
it
be
so
poorly
do
and
Hitler
face
look
like
a
cartoon
character
that
I
could
not
help
myself
that
be
a
weird
look
Hitler
what
be
so
weird
about
it
he
face
look
funny
look
Funny
I
could
tell
that
Ronnie
actually
do
not
appreciate
my
criticism
of
he
tattoo
I
think
he
be
a
little
stunned
that
I
would
actually
say
anything
he
probably
have
a
lot
of
pride
in
it
but
I
think
it
be
very
silly
look
then
there
be
the
tattoo
in
the
category
of
they
own
I
be
a
felon
obviously
because
I
be
a
felon
Bruce
Camel
army
of

just
like

would
probably
have
to
say
the
one
I
get

the
middle
of
the
armpit
it
be
like
a
burning
pain
it
almost

real
hot
as

tell
I

memory
road
map
we
conduct
some
very
difficult
interview
in

ask
the
inmate
to
reflect
on
some
terrible
thing
that
they
have
experience
year
ago

one
way
for

discretion
be
advise
if
there
be
one
place
to
discover
the
blues
it
be
in
the
nation
prison
and
jail
incarceration
bring
not
only
the
lack
of
freedom
but
cramped
quarter
and
the
ever
present
threat
of
violence
but
we
find
one
of
the
most
discuss
and
revile
aspect
of
prison
life
be
the
food
this
be
the
jungle
you
want
to
eat
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
we
be
not
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
animal
we
be
not
dog
you
feed
dog
you
serve
we
chow
and
portion
size
rarely
compare
to
those
on
the
street
this
be
for
little
kid
that
be
why
we
pray
pray
for
canteen
should
focus
on
how
little
these
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
tray
be
grow
ass
man
eat
these
little
ass
tray
see
these
little
ass
portion
dog
they
get
to
do
something
about
this
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
these
meal
be
not
even
enough
if
you
be
anorexic
be
not
no
sunshine
in
this
jail
but
the
biggest
complaint
be
the
taste
the
food
be
ridiculous
it
be
slop
I
would
not
even
feed
that
kind
of
food
to
my
animal
the
food
be
disgust
nasty
I
do
not
know
what
that
be
I
do
not
know
what
that
be
I
do
not
know
what
that
be
and
a
green
banana
help
we
please
people
help
we
I
have
be
film
inside
prison
for
a
long
time
and
I
think
I
can
count
on
one
hand
the
number
of
inmate
that
not
only
have
say
that
the
food
be
good
but
that
the
food
be
okay
acceptable
literally
one
hand
prison
food
be
good
what
be
that
I
say
prison
food
good
you
be
officially
the
first
person
that
we
have
ever
hear
say
that
it
be
a
different
story
at
the
Maricopa
County
jail
in
Phoenix
where
the
food
delivery
system
--
well
you
can
see
for
yourself
this
be
kibble
and
bit
and
beefy
bit
right
here
I
mean
dark
food
this
would
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
make
you
go
crazy
get
to
hurt
people
I
do
not
even
know
what
I
have
but
that
reaction
be
exactly
the
one
the
man
who
run
the
jail
strive
for
sheriff
Joe
Arpaio
say
he
simply
want
to
motivate
inmate
to
not
come
back
we
meal
go
up
from
15
cent
to
18
I
be
not
too
happy
with
that
you
know
we
have
a
little
inflation
we
give
they
two
meal
a
day
brunch
this
be
it
that
be
all
you
get
until
dinnertime
usually
a
Bologna
sandwich
a
orange
donate
cookie
and
at
night
they
get
a
hot
meal
a
lot
of
these
guy
will
not
talk
up
but
I
be
go
tell
you
what
I
think
the
food
here
be
garbage
bro
you
do
not
eat
it
no
how
come
the
only
thing
I
ever
eat
be
the
fruit
the
only
reason
I
take
the
tray
be
so
that
I
can
talk
to
everybody
in
the
run
because
when
they
give
you
you
food
the
trap
stay
open
until
they
pick
it
up
I
do
not
eat
it
though
we
throw
more
of
it
away
than
we
eat
honestly
the
food
that
we
get
--
well
once
you
serve
it
you
can
not
use
it
for
anything
else
do
you
have
food
in
Wyoming
we
do
and
we
recognize
it
no
but
seriously
I
get
more
people
in
jail

close
to
100
inmate

day
they
work
eight-hour
day
they
work
from
around
in
the
morning
until
or
in
the
afternoon
and
come
in
around
and
work
until
or

on
what
shift

be
assign
to
many
of
the

very
cold
in
a
lot
of
the
area
some
be
very
warm
wet
they
still
have
to
come
here

it
be
necessary
to
get
we
production

try
this
but
at
the
same
time
out
of
politeness
of

welcome
to
the
belly
of
the
beast
we
hear
a
lot
of
inmate
describe
prison
as
the
belly
of
the
beast
this
place
suck
man
it
be
usually
not
use
to
describe
prison
kitchen
but
that
might
be
the
most
appropriate
use
of
the
phrase
there
be
we
crew
be
always
look
for
way
to
get
these
kind
of
iconic
prison
or
jail
shot
and
the
kitchen
be
a
great
place
to
get
they
because
I
do
not
think
anything
really
say
incarceration
more
than
see
some
bland
food
scoop
on
to
a
institutional
tray
by
a
6
4
inmate
cover
in
tattoo
and
the
funny
thing
about
the
food
be
inmate
always
complain
about
it
but
inevitably
they
be
always
look
for
way
to
get
more
of
it
this
be
so
we
do
not
starve
later
on
but
if
you
want
to
see
a
real
sack
look
over
there
show
they
what
you
get
but
if
you
be
go
to
do
it
if
you
be
go
to
take
a
chance
at
get
catch
do
it
in
a
big
way
go
big
or
go
home
and
since
we
can
not
go
home
--
this
be
how
we
do
it
here
most
inmate
meal
be
prepared
and
serve
by
other
inmate
kitchen
work
be
far
from
glamorous
but
it
have
its
perk
the
reason
I
do
it
be
to
get
out
of
my
cell
come
down
here
get
a
little
freedom
and
eat
a
little
better
Ray
SLAGEL
love
work
in
the
kitchen
at
the
Limon
correctional
facility
in
Colorado
because
he
could
trade
extra
food
for
token
coin
slot
use
to
purchase
ice
cream
and
soda
from
prison
vend
machine
how
much
be
a
cheeseburger
two
token
I
say
double
cheeseburger
I
should
have
show
you
one
double
cheeseburger
two
token
that
be
a
good
deal
yeah
yeah
I
can
not
even
get
they
fast
enough
you
know
I
usually
sell
two
of
those
a
day
while
most
menu
be
design
to
provide
a
basic
level
of
nutrition
Steven
Doad
the
food
service
director
at
the
Hillsboro
County
jail
in
Tampa
Florida
have
take
a
more
wholesome
approach
to
inmate
meal
we
make
up
meal
a
day
and
we
have
a
28-day
cycle
menu
which
have
a
variety
for
the
inmate
and
we
last
menu
design
we
decide
we
be
go
to
make
this
a
heart
healthy
menu
that
be
the
only
jail
in
Florida
that
I
know
of
that
do
a
heart
healthy
menu
the
food
have
to
have
calorie
per
day
we
have
33
%
or
less
fat
we
have
gram
of
sodium
per
day
or
less
there
be
the
100
%
require
amount
of
vitamin
and
mineral
to
make
a
healthy
lifestyle
for
anyone
most
inmate
be
hire
for
kitchen
job
base
on
they
behavior
history
and
the
trust
they
have
earn
from
staff
as
oppose
to
any
culinary
experience
John
Powers
meet
all
of
those
qualification
but
he
also
just
happen
to
be
the
real
deal
I
work
at
a
restaurant
I
be
a
culinary
chef
I
be
a
sous
chef
I
have
own
a
couple
of
steakhouse
in
the
area
a
caribbean
restaurant
in
Hernando
County
I
have
be
in
the
food
business
since
1985
since
most
inmate
complain
about
the
food
we
ask
power
for
a
professional
evaluation
it
be
bland
a
lot
of
the
food
be
bland
and
I
agree
to
somewhat
it
be
not
enough
food
but
once
you
be
here
for
a
week
or
two
week
you
get
use
to
it
people
be
eat
--
use
to
be
on
the
street
and
eating
when
they
want
and
what
they
want
unfortunately
when
you
come
here
that
be
not
what
you
get
to
do
it
be
not
enough
to
fill
you
just
enough
to
put
something
in
you
stomach
to
keep
you
go
there
be
chicken
in
here
but
the
chicken
be
not
real
good
chicken
very
bad
chicken
but
anyway
whatever
it
be
what
it
be
I
eat
to
survive
I
think
that
the
food
taste
reasonably
good
what
we
have
do
be
try
to
create
neutral
food
taste
so
if
the
food
be
bland
at
least
they
be
not
have
something
that
they
find
objectionable
once
you
be
here
a
little
bit
you
be
like
you
know
what
it
be
really
not
that
bad
a
little
salt
would
be
nice
and
pepper
but
other
than
that
it
be
you
know
it
be
hard
you
keep
look
over
you
shoulder
at
the
other
chef
here
how
come
be
that
chef
code
I
work
for
he
so
--
that
be
like
the
boss
so
I
will
make
sure
I
do
not
say
anything
too
bad
I
do
not
want
to
offend
he
or
say
anything
out
of
line
I
be
sure
I
will
have
a
little
talk
with
he
when
we
be
do
with
this
conversation
back
at
the
Limon
correctional
facility
we
encounter
perhaps
the
most
unusual
of
all
inmate
meal
it
be
call
meal
loaf
prepare
for
we
by
Captain
Hubbard
it
be
a
sort
of
self-contained
meal
for
inmate
who
tend
to
throw
they
food
in
they
cell
or
at
other
what
we
have
get
here
be
basically
all
of
the
food
group
nine
ounce
of
ground
beef
carrot
be
weigh
out
shredded
potato
shredded
cabbage
seven
ounce
vegetable
oil
bean
ten
ounce
precooked
tomato
puree
hopefully
it
will
hold
together
fairly
well
the
recipe
say
to
put
it
in
a
loaf
pan
but
this
will
do
just
fine
this
should
weigh
out
at
about
pound
and
it
go
in
the
oven
at
325
degree
very
very
nutritious
dish
do
not
take
it
long
to
heat
up
when
Captain
Hubbard
make
one
for
we
it
do
not
look
bad
watch
he
make
it
it
be
almost
like
make
you
average
meatloaf
but
the
inmate
describe
it
as
be
so
horrible
they
act
like
it
be
the
worst
thing
you
could
possibly
have
when
in
actuality
I
would
see
thing
on
the
menu
that
be
much
worse
look
than
this
meal
loaf
by
reputation
they
do
not
care
for
it
at
all
I
have
taste
it
it
be
not
really
that
bad
inmate
Carlos
Alexander
would
be
he
own
judge
this
be
horrible
that
be
good
you
for
real
man
this
be
good
it
taste
like
cardboard
all
ought
to
try
some
of
this
Jake
you
want
to
eat
that
I
want
salt
and
pepper
that
be
cheating
though
right
it
be
not
that
bad
it
actually
be
not
too
bad
it
be
very
bland
but
if
you
have
the
right
condiment
it
would
have
be
like
a
standard
meatloaf
almost
unfortunately
the
inmate
in
SEG
never
have
the
right
condiment
that
be
horrible
I
do
not
think
a
dog
would
eat
that

spend

security
prison
and
you
might
just
find
yourself
re-evaluate
you
waistline
and
you
commitment
to
the
gym
when
we
visit
San
Quentin
State
prison
we
discover
how
commit
some
of
the
inmate
be
to
they
workout
the
state
of
California
ban
free
weight
from
the
rec
yard
for
security
reason
but
that
do
not
deter
anyone
from
lifting
it
be
weight
yeah
yeah
that
be
how
we
work
out
we
get
water
bag
we
do
not
get
weight
anymore
how
much
do
it
weigh
about
30
pound
not
very
much
there
it
be
some
of
the
challenge
of
work
out
in
prison
be
not
only
about
the
access
to
the
equipment
you
have
or
do
not
have
but
it
be
also
the
kind
of
restriction
you
have
oftentimes
these
prison
go
on
lockdown
and
people
be
keep
in
they
cell
or
housing
unit
for
long
period
of
time
and
not
really
allow
out
but
they
still
always
find
a
way
to
work
out
this
be
about
55
or
60
pound
and
in
a
world
where
fist
fight
be
all
too
real
many
inmate
incorporate
shadow
boxing
into
they
workout
but
Jamie
Daniels
a
former
jujitsu
instructor
do
time
at
Indiana
State
prison
go
beyond
just
punch
air
this
be
a
makeshift
punching
bag
since
we
be
in
we
cell
23-plus
hour
a
day
I
take
a
wool
blanket
whatever
you
need
some
people
put
a
book
in
there
to
make
it
harder
it
be
not
as
give
as
a
regular
punching
bag
but
we
do
with
what
we
get
I
be
come
back
here
and
just
fire
off
some
punch
about
50
60
jab
this
be
probably
one
of
the
best
exercise
to
do
in
here
you
can
do
a
whole
lot
of
punching
and
it
work
the
whole
part
of
you
body
one
of
the
more
memorable
punch
we
ever
see
come
from
a
female
inmate
Paula
Rivas
at
the
Orange
County
jail
I
be
a
fighter
I
use
my
fist
I
use
to
go
to
the
boxing
gym
and
I
train
I
really
like
get
that
shot
of
Paula
and
the
basketball
she
definitely
stand
out
amongst
the
other
female
inmate
and
man
that
look
like
a
really
difficult
thing
to
do
I
look
pretty
much
good
for
my
age
I
be
44
year
old
and
I
look
a
lot
better
than
some
of
they
youngster
I
know
I
be
handsome
Rivas
have
a
in-cell
workout
that
would
rival
most
of
the
mens
as
well
inmate
when
they
be
work
out
the
impression
it
make
upon
I
be
how
disciplined
they
be
they
keep
track
of
every
sit-up
every
push-up
every
squat
every
curl
you
name
it
I
notice
one
day
there
be
a
inmate
that
be
pacing
back
and
forth
in
they
cell
and
she
have
play
card
and
she
would
place
a
card
on
the
table
go
back
to
the
end
of
the
cell
come
forward
and
as
she
be
pass
the
table
she
put
another
card
down
and
we
ask
she
what
that
be
all
about
hey
what
be
the
card
for
to
count
my
mile
three
deck
of
card
be
one
mile
so
it
make
it
easier
so
you
do
not
walk
in
circle
all
day
work
out
be
also
a
good
way
to
kill
time
there
be
a
lot
of
time
to
be
spend
in
prison
and
this
be
just
one
more
way
to
do
it
at
the
Suffolk
County
jail
in
Boston
we
encounter
one
group
of
inmate
who
find
work
out
as
a
team
keep
they
more
motivated
than
work
out
alone
get
that
ab
workout
get
it
tone
up
this
crew
right
here
that
be
what
we
do
all

we
here
forever
get
to
do
something
with
you
time
always
work
out
always
work
on
my
mind
my
body
my
soul
that
be
pretty
much
it
in
another
section
of
the
jail
we
discover
a
group
of
woman
also
work
on
mind
body
and
soul
but
in
a
most
unexpected
way
lift
the
buttock
up
any
amount
excellent
move
the
inner
thigh
through
the
back
wall
we
find
out
that
once
a
week
a
professional
yoga
instructor
would
come
inside
the
jail
and
teach
yoga
to
the
woman
we
decide
to
cover
it
and
when
we
get
there
we
see
a
normal
classroom
environment
have
be
transform
into
a
yoga
studio
they
have
push
the
chair
and
table
back
against
the
wall
and
set
up
they
yoga
mat
against
the
great
large
window
and
really
create
a
peaceful
environment
now
use
you
breath
I
be
want
to
teach
yoga
in
jail
for
a
very
long
time
I
find
yoga
be
a
wonderful
beneficial
part
of
reduce
the
stress
but
it
also
bring
a
sense
of
calmness
and
peace
you
may
find
you
mind
be
wander
yoga
be
a
way
to
control
the
scattered
mind
the
fluctuate
mind
be
you
guide
force
now
I
do
not
believe
any
of
the
woman
have
do
yoga
before
so
this
be
something
really
new
for
each
one
of
they
afterwards
you
could
tell
that
they
really
get
something
out
of
it
it
be
more
than
just
get
out
of
they
cell
for
a
hour
and
it
be
not
like
the
other
sort
of
classroom
style
program
they
go
to
the
experience
be
really
emotional
for
some
of
they
which
part
of
it
do
you
like
the
most
I
would
say
the
last
part
because
then
you
could
just
sit
there
and
breathe
and
a
lot
of
thought
run
through
you
head
like
what
everything
good
thing
bad
thing
be
you
okay
bring
you
in
touch
with
yourself
yeah
it
be
not
a
bad
thing
it
should
give
you
some
sense
of
relief
yeah
yeah
I
would
do
it
again
you
would
do
it
again
yes
and
it
be
perfectly
okay
to
cry
just
get
it
out
of
the
system
yeah
that
be
why
I
would
love
for
you
to
be
back
I
will
be
back
I
will
be
back
yeah

very
quick
ly
that
a
lot
of
they
hear

and
really
do
not

take
place
but
two
people
who
talk
to
Israel
Radio
describe
this
man
as
be
all
dress
in
black
you
see
he
leave
that
bag
behind
we
be
also
hear
a
clip
behind
from
that
gun
this
be
all
crucial
piece
of
evidence
go
forward
he
say
they
still
do
not
know
if
this
be
criminal
or
a
terrorist
attack
but
we
have
see
those
they
be
tell
resident
to
go
about
they
daily
life
be
more
precautious
the
police
be
say
they
do
not
have
intelligence
lead
up
to
this
a
big
manhunt
under
way
there
be
also
be
a
frightening
incident
at
a
mosque
in
France
a
driver
try
to
run
over
soldier
guard
the
mosque
they
open
fire
after
he
ram
into
they
twice
the
driver
and
a
number
of
soldier
be
injure
all
of
this
happen
as
two
busy
train
station
in
Munich
reopen
after
a
terror
threat
close
they
new
year
eve
senior
international
correspondent
Frederick
PLIEK
Ennis
cover
this
from
London
give
we
the
latest
the
incident
in
France
the
soldier
be
part
of
a
special
operation
they
launch
after
the
Paris
attack
recently
they
put
extra
security
in
front
of
religious
place
you
have
they
in
front
of
synagogue
church
mosque
as
well
from
what
we
gather
the
soldier
be
wait
in
front
of
the
building
the
man
be
then
order
to
stop
he
car
as
he
approach
they
he
do
not
do
that
ran
into
the
group
the
first
time
then
reverse
try
to
ram
they
again
that
be
when
they
open
fire
there
be
a
scene
later
where
the
carve
the
man
be
stop
on
the
side
of
the
road
a
red
station
wagon
he
be
lightly
wound
in
the
leg
and
arm
anywhere
between
1
and
4
soldier
be
hurt
in
that
incident
as
well
it
be
interesting
the
french
authority
say
it
seem
to
be
a
isolate
incident
but
have
not
be
able
to
question
the
man
yet
isolate
they
think
it
be
a
lone
wolf
attack
it
be
a
big
question
at
this
moment
certainly
at
this
point
the
french
authority
be
not
willing
to
speculate
they
do
not
know
they
have
not
be
able
to
speak
to
the
man
when
they
say
isolate
incident
do
not
appear
it
be
part
of
a
wider
plot
still
be
very
much
unclear
what
exactly
this
man
motive
with
be
be
this
someone
that
want
some
sort
of
political
statement
or
something
as
part
of
this
it
be
unclear
at
this
point
in
time
certainly
show
how
on
edge
security
service
be
after
the
Paris
attack
in
Europe
in
general
as
they
deal
with
the
terror
threaten
gulf
almost
the
entire
continent
update
we
in
Germany
the
train
station
be
open
be
there
concern
there
could
be
a
terror
attack
the
coming
day
they
say
they
have
no
information
that
a
attack
could
be
imminent
the
threat
level
in
Munich
stay
high
I
have
be
cover
Germany
a
long
time
it
be
a
long
time
since
I
read
a
press
release
by
the
police
that
I
read
last
night
with
that
sense
of
urgency
they
be
say
they
believe
a
attack
could
be
imminent
have
a
time
it
be
suppose
to
take
place
right
at
midnight
they
be
look
for
5
to
7
people
that
want
to
conduct
terror
attack
at
the
main
Munich
railway
station
or
another
commuter
station
west
of
Munich
right
now
the
police
be
search
four
individual
of
iraqi
and
syrian
descent
they
even
get
name
of
some
of
the
individual
but
they
be
not
sure
if
these
be
phony
or
real
they
say
at
this
point
the
manhunt
be
under
way
they
be
try
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
plot
be
real
a
lot
of
information
to
follow
up
on
thank
you
so
much
I
want
to
go
back
to
the
story
out
of
Tel
Aviv
one
woman
a
producer
at
Huffington
post
be
on
vacation
near
the
pub
that
it
happen
if
she
hurt
gunshot
something
incredible
after
the
shot
ring
out
I
be
in
the
store
about
five
store
up
north
of
where
the
shooting
occur
hear
multiple
round
of
gunshot
then
people
pull
over
car
something
I
have
never
see
before
usually
in
the
United
States
but
leap
out
of
car
one
with
a
handgun
to
pursue
the
individual
that
do
this
it
be
a
lot
of
Israelis
and
people
in
Tel
Aviv
run
toward
the
scene
as
other
get
away
from
it
it
be
a
confusing
scene
when
it
happen
there
be
so
much
to
talk
about
here
I
want
to
bring
in
Karen
Greenburg
director
at
the
center
on
National
Security
at
Fordham
University
Law
School
thank
you
for
be
with
we
you
say
and
I
think
it
feel
this
way
for
so
many
people
that
terrorism
have
change
I
do
not
know
if
it
have
change
it
be
evolve
to
a
point
where
what
be
change
be
how
the
public
and
police
seem
to
addre
it
so
you
have
see
a
host
of
threat
some
of
which
we
do
not
know
about
some
be
make
public
across
the
globe
what
you
be
really
see
be
a
measure
of
control
by
authority
both
of
fear
of
public
sentiment
ability
to
handle
these
thing
the
one
place
there
seem
to
have
be
this
attack
which
be
Israel
sort
of
the
heart
of
how
much
terrorism
language
and
sentiment
particularly
in
the
day
of
Al
Qaeda
about
send
Mitch
of
terrorism
there
be
restaurant
attack
in
Paris
there
be
a
shooting
in
broad
daylight
in
Israel
obviously
the
cause
they
be
look
for
at
this
point
they
be
concern
it
could
be
terrorism
do
this
sound
to
you
like
perhaps
a
new
wave
of
soft
target
attack
or
Lone
Wolf
attack
you
know
you
never
know
what
be
new
the
lone
wolf
that
you
raise
in
prior
interview
be
this
a
lone
wolf
or
organize
attack
it
can
be
plan
a
lone
wolf
therefore
the
distinction
between
crime
and
terrorism
get
minimize
be
this
a
individual
that
may
have
sentiment
or
be
this
organize
do
it
matter
in
the
long
run
we
be
see
the
con
volume
ug
of
two
thing
that
be
harder
to
separate
out
and
pose
new
challenge
for
law
enforcement
we
have
see
different
city
respond
to
different
threat
even
recently
as
versus
New
York
whether
they
shut
down
school
or
not
for
it
in
Germany
authority
shut
down
two
train
station
because
of
a
threat
that
they
be
try
to
figure
out
if
it
be
real
how
should
city
be
respond
to
these
threat
when
it
be
unclear
to
they
whether
they
be
substantiate
I
think
that
be
a
excellent
question
what
we
have
see
in
the
wake
of
San
Bernardino
and
then
close
down
of
school
in
be
that
each
--
I
think
each
municipality
each
state
each
country
be
go
to
adopt
its
own
response
and
it
be
go
to
be
a
response
that
take
into
account
public
fear
the
ability
of
they
law
enforcement
agency
and
intelligence
agency
to
feel
like
they
have
control
of
the
situation
and
it
be
go
to
be
different
in
different
place
that
be
what
we
need
to
get
use
to
that
be
okay
there
be
a
lot
of
criticism
for
shut
down
they
school
system
and
that
be
understandable
but
everybody
have
to
do
what
they
be
comfortable
with
not
all
city
be
like
New
York
or
for
that
matter
Tel
Aviv
which
have
be
live
with
terrorist
threat
for
a
long
time
think
about
it
and
have
the
kind
of
resource
to
deploy
that
other
city
may
not
have
so
I
think
you
will
see
a
variety
over
time
it
be
not
a
cookie
cutter
solution
and
I
think
that
be
wise
and
reflect
some
kind
of
judgment
so
close
to
San
Bernardino
clearly
that
factored
into
some
decision
make
there
Karen
Greenburg
thank
you
so
much
happy
new
year
to
you
happy

I

I
be
still
go
for
my
personal
best
and
for
eliqui
reduce
risk
of

plus
less

ask
you

several
count
of
in
decent
assault
in
Montgomery
County
Pennsylvania
the
victim
in
that
be
not
part
of
this
suit
with
the
seven
woman
why
do
they
want
to
speak
to
Camille
Cosby
here
be
the
man
to
answer
that
the
attorney
for
the
seven
woman
sue
cosby
and
also
with
I
be
CNN
Jean
Casarez
who
be
all
over
this
story
and
in
the
courtroom
the
other
day
in
Montgomery
County
welcome
to
you
Joseph
thanks
for
be
with
we
thank
you
for
have
I
what
specifically
be
the
knowledge
that
Camille
Cosby
have
I
understand
it
have
to
do
with
the
fact
she
be
she
husband
business
manager
well
first
of
all
she
be
he
wife
of
some
50
some
odd
year
she
be
know
Cosby
since
she
be
19
she
have
information
that
be
relevant
to
the
issue
in
this
case
for
example
he
relationship
that
he
be
have
with
other
woman
sexual
proclivity
use
of
quaa
quaaludes
she
be
he
business
manager
Cosby
maintain
that
my
seven
client
gather
together
and
in
essence
conspire
to
rail
he
remergence
on
NBC
or
Netflix
clearly
as
business
manager
she
will
have
information
what
impact
if
any
these
woman
have
on
he
business
so
there
be
many
many
topic
that
be
relevant
another
one
that
come
to
mind
be
it
have
be
report
in
the
press
that
Cosby
be
lead
a
public
relation
effort
to
get
out
in
front
of
the
accusation
that
have
be
make
by
my
client
against
Cosby
so
we
have
be
permit
to
ask
she
question
we
intend
to
do
so
on
January
6th
in
Springfield
Massachusetts
do
you
expect
that
she
attorney
will
be
able
to
assert
privilege
if
you
be
ask
she
question
about
interaction
that
she
be
have
with
she
husband
some
of
that
could
definitely
be
protect
right
be
that
what
you
be
expect
no
no
and
no
why
be
that
why
would
you
have
the
ability
to
do
that
let
I
tell
you
why
because
Massachusetts
law
do
not
recognize
a
privilege
a
protection
against
obtain
communication
between
a
husband
and
spouse
what
the
law
do
provide
be
that
the
testimony
that
may
be
give
can
not
be
use
at
trial
be
not
admissible
or
able
to
be
present
to
a
jury
however
that
information
may
be
gather
in
a
deposition
and
it
may
be
use
and
assist
in
develop
other
information
that
could
be
admit
into
a
trial
the
cosby
lawyer
do
ask
the
court
and
raise
that
claim
of
privilege
with
the
judge
in
they
attempt
to
prevent
we
from
take
she
deposition
the
judge
reject
they
argument
and
say
there
be
no
such
privilege
and
that
it
be
one
of
competence
mean
the
ability
to
use
that
testimony
only
at
trial
which
do
not
preclude
a
deposition
a
fact-finding
question
answer
process
before
trial
Jean
tell
we
how
Camille
cosby
talk
about
the
allegation
in
recent
month
she
really
have
not
several
time
they
have
be
in
public
she
have
be
by
he
side
they
appear
to
be
a
very
close
couple
as
they
be
in
they
senior
year
now
the
knowledge
she
may
or
may
not
have
be
critical
to
the
plaintiff
but
she
would
be
the
silent
one
as
he
would
talk
I
remember
the
allegation
earlier
that
she
be
in
a
sense
behind
some
statement
that
have
come
out
the
original
suit
Tamara
Green
be
the
primary
plaintiff
that
come
forward
she
be
allege
many
thing
but
two
separate
thing
Newsweek
magazine
in
February
2014
when
she
speak
out
and
the
response
they
get
from
cosby
say
she
be
a
liar
then
the
Washington
post
article
shortly
after
that
then
cosby
say
she
be
a
liar
and
the
question
be
who
be
behind
that
and
business
speaking
it
be
important
one
would
say
to
save
that
business
and
preclude
it
have
any
harm
come
from
the
business
what
he
be
say
I
understand
they
need
to
see
if
the
business
manager
have
any
part
in
that
how
hurtful
or
maybe
would
this
have
no
impact
on
bill
cosby
case
what
be
the
possible
outcome
here
Jean
from
the
deposition
of
he
wife
talk
about
the
criminal
case
yes
in
a
case
two
separate
distinct
thing
with
a
deposition
you
never
know
what
will
happen
it
be
swear
testimony
you
never
know
what
will
be
say
but
criminal
charge
be
those
against
Bill
Cosby
and
bill
cosby
alone
and
obviously
a
decade
earlier
in
regard
to
one
person
Andrea
con
Stan
someone
he
know
in
Pennsylvania
I
want
to
look
at
something
that
Bill
Cosby
talk
about
this
be
a
1991
here
on
CNN
let
watch
this
spanish
fly
be
the
thing
that
all
boy
from
age
11
on
up
to
death
we
will
still
be
search
for
spanish
fly
and
what
be
the
old
story
be
if
you
take
a
little
drop
it
be
on
the
head
of
a
pin
put
it
in
the
drink
COCA-COLA
do
not
matter
and
the
girl
would
drink
it
and
hello
America
so
Jean
for
we
viewer
put
those
comment
into
context
well
spanish
fly
be
elude
to
drug
and
woman
and
woman
after
woman
include
Andrea
Constand
be
allege
she
be
drug
accord
to
the
criminal
complaint
and
she
then
become
the
victim
of
a
sexual
assault
and
he
not
only
say
that
to
Larry
King
it
be
also
in
the
comedy
routine
part
of
a
record
album
from
the
1970
I
believe
obviously
one
would
say
state
of
mind
of
Bill
Cosby
that
this
be
important
to
he
in
many
respects
I
interview
Joseph
Monique
Presley
Bill
Cosby
lawyer
yesterday
she
say
that
prove
nothing
the
quaaludes
from
decade
ago
prove
nothing
this
be
--
she
sort
of
make
this
case
that
that
be
year
ago
it
be
irrelevant
but
I
assume
that
you
do
not
see
that
and
that
be
this
some
evidence
even
comment
about
spanish
fly
that
you
may
use
in
you
lawsuit
well
first
of
all
can
you
expect
that
Monique
Presley
be
go
to
say
he
comment
have
any
relevance
or
that
it
be
important
or
that
it
be
detrimental
to
bill
Cosby
you
be
talk
to
he
defense
lawyer
what
be
she
go
to
say
anything
but
that
so
that
mean
nothing
that
be
a
zero
in
term
of
whether
or
not
it
be
important
of
course
it
be
this
be
a
man
that
be
fixate
with
this
mythical
drug
that
can
somehow
alter
the
mind
of
unsuspecting
woman
so
he
could
have
he
way
with
they
that
be
he
routine
and
he
write
in
a
book
of
he
when
he
write
and
speak
in
he
comedy
routine
he
be
write
and
speak
from
real
life
true
experience
that
he
have
have
so
the
use
of
quaaludes
which
be
know
to
be
a
controlled
substance
that
have
very
serious
deleterious
effect
on
one
ability
to
maintain
they
consciousness
be
use
by
Bill
Cosby
and
he
admit
to
use
it
to
one
of
the
seven
woman
I
be
represent
in
East
and
se
become
incapacitated
she
maintain
she
do
not
give
consent
to
have
sex
with
bill
cosby
Bill
cosby
testify
he
could
not
say
whether
or
not
she
consent
use
of
this
spanish
fly
use
of
drug
that
be
all
relevant
to
the
issue
at
hand
because
many
of
the
woman
of
the
seven
I
represent
and
the
other
40
some
odd
that
have
come
out
have
say
they
have
be
drug
and
then
follow
that
have
be
sexually
abused
and
assault
remain
to
be
see
who
be
tell
the
truth

case

new
question
about
gray
health
be
be
raise
ten
day
before
the
trial
begin
for
the
police
officer
that
drive
the
van
where
gray
be
fatally
injure
defense
attorney
for
officer
Caesar
good
son

complain
about
back
problem
week
before
suffer
a
spinal
cord
injury
the
officer
be
charge
with
secondary
deprafd
murder
that
be
he
on
the
right
the
defense
cite
a
recently
unsealed
police
document
that
state
gray
allegedly
mention
he
back
pain
when
he
meet
with
Baltimore
police
two
week
before
the
April
arrest
I
want
to
bring
in
Miguel
Marquez
and
Baltimore
Defense
Attorney
and
CNN
contributor
Andrew
Alpersteen
talk
about
the
internal
police
document
that
describe
it
it
be
a
interesting
tale
this
be
a
document
that
arise
out
of
gray
give
information
to
the
police
regard
a
robbery
after
Gray
this
be
on
March
31st
2015
Gray
be
arrest
and
then
injure
in
that
van
on
April
12th
about
two
week
later
die
April
19th
the
riot
or
worst
of
it
be
on
the
27th
of
April
and
then
on
May
1st
the
officer
who
write
this
internal
memo
basically
say
he
memory
be
jog
by
all
of
the
conversation
about
it
in
the
press
about
Freddie
Gray
he
remember
this
detail
that
gray
tell
he
that
he
have
either
quote
a
bad
back
or
quote
have
suffer
a
back
injury
but
there
be
no
mention
of
how
serious
it
be
or
what
it
be
prosecutor
basically
defense
attorney
want
all
of
Gray
medical
record
in
the
trial
prosecutor
say
it
be
not
necessary
be
not
serious
information
and
Gray
die
from
neck
injury
not
a
back
injury
all
of
this
be
beside
the
point
be
this
something
that
the
defense
could
use
that
would
be
relevant
that
could
be
use
very
effectively
potentially
I
think
what
be
happen
here
be
that
this
report
come
up
middle
of
the
first
trial
officer
porter
whose
trial
complete
a
couple
week
ago
there
be
a
hung
jury
during
the
course
of
the
trial
issue
center
around
what
the
officer
know
and
when
and
the
medical
information
be
be
use
and
the
science
that
exist
in
medicine
to
show
how
somebody
body
would
react
to
a
certain
injury
and
how
quickly
they
system
would
start
shut
down
be
use
as
the
basis
for
the
state
medical
information
to
say
this
be
when
the
officer
would
have
see
what
they
see
remember
this
be
not
a
case
about
what
somebody
actually
do
to
he
but
it
be
more
about
the
officer
failure
to
do
thing
failure
to
provide
medical
care
failure
to
provide
a
seat
belt
with
failure
to
provide
medical
care
the
critical
issue
be
what
do
the
officer
know
when
as
to
the
driver
come
up
soon
for
trial
as
he
be
point
out
the
issue
when
and
what
they
know
become
critical
if
he
have
a
pre-existing
injury
that
be
something
the
defense
be
scream
about
say
we
be
entitle
to
have
this
it
come
out
middle
of
the
first
trial
so
defense
could
not
have
they
medical
people
look
at
it
in
advance
medical
people
for
the
defense
already
form
they
opinion
the
state
doctor
say
it
have
no
relevance
anyway
because
as
Migel
say
it
be
the
back
not
the
neck
we
see
what
we
see
on
the
autopsy
could
this
help
the
defense
team
get
access
to
gray
medical
record
interesting
the
prosecution
be
say
you
do
not
need
those
well
the
interesting
thing
be
they
ask
for
it
before
and
the
judge
tell
they
no
next
Wednesday
there
will
be
another
hearing
about
they
ask
again
say
we
do
not
know
this
before
so
we
want
to
get
he
prior
medical
record
they
be
fish
around
to
see
what
they
can
find
once
they
find
it
then
they
will
know
what
to
do
with
it
right
now
we
be
in
discovery
phase
not
whether
it
will
be
use
in
trial
and
to
be
clear
this
memo
a
police
officer
write
this
be
do
thinking
--
this
be
not
something
that
be
file
at
the
time
right
this
be
file
later
it
do
not
appear
to
be
part
of
the
actual
investigation
it
be
after
the
fact
on
May
1st
this
police
officer
--
after
the
death
after
the
death
after
the
rights
on
a
unsolicited
basis
send
this
to
different
superior
in
Baltimore
Police
Department
say
hey
I
just
remember
this
here
it
be
prosecutor
come
across
it
discard
it
defense
lawyer
want
to
dig
into
this
they
be
use
it
to
get
at
the
medical
record
what
they
will
find
be
the
big
question
thank
you
so
much
to
both
of
you
next
what
the
Affluenza
fugitive
allegedly
do
during
he
time
on
the
run
and
how
he
mother
who
be
back
now
in
the
be
defend
herself
plus
my
next
guest
know
a
lot
about
Affluenza
write
a
book
on
the
topic
say
it
be
not
the
first
time
the
defense
have
be
use
I
sure
have
a
lot
on
my
mind
when
I
get
out
of
the
hospital
after
a
dvt
blood
clot
what
about
my
family
my
Li
l
buddy
and
what
if
this
happen
again
I
be
give
warfarin
in
the
hospital
but
I
wonder
if
this
be
the
right
treatment
for
I
then
my
doctor
tell
I
about
eliqui
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
and
reduce
the
risk
of
they
happen
again
not
only
do
ELIQUIS
treat
dvt
and
pe
blood
clot
but
eliquis
also
have
significantly
less
major
bleeding
than
the
standard
treatment
know
Eliquis
have
both
turn
around
my
thinking
do
not
stop
eliquis
unless
you
doctor
tell
you
to
Eliquis
can
cause
serious
and
in
rare
case
fatal
bleeding
do
not
take
Eliquis
if
you
have
a
artificial
heart
valve
or
abnormal
bleeding
if
you
have
a
spinal
injection
while
on
Eliquis
call
you
doctor
right
away
if
you
have
tingling
numbness
or
muscle
weakness
while
take
Eliquis
you
may
bruise
more
easily
and
it
may
take
longer
than
usual
for
bleed
to
stop
seek
immediate
medical
care
for
sudden
sign
of
bleeding
like
unusual
bruising
Eliquis
may
increase
you
bleeding
risk
if
you
take
certain
medicine
tell
you
doctor
about
all
plan
medical
or
dental
procedure
ELIQUIS
treat
DVT
PE
blood
clot
plus
have
less
major
bleeding
both
make
switching
to
eliqui
right
for
I
ask
you
doctor
if
it
be
right
for
you

co-producer
of
the
documentary
for
PBS
John
we
be
get
new
detail
about
they
time
the
couch
time
in
New
Mexico
Dallas
morning
news
speak
to
a
employee
at
the
hideout
in
Mexico
the
employee
say
one
night
he
go
to
a
strip
club
the
manager
follow
he
to
the
hotel
to
have
he
mom
pay
for
he
bar
tab
you
look
at
that
you
think
there
be
no
question
that
this
be
a
kid
with
a
case
of
Affluenza
I
think
he
be
a
extreme
case
of
Affluenza
I
think
this
be
also
a
case
of
the
golden
rule
in
action
namely
that
whoever
have
the
gold
make
the
rule
this
kid
really
get
off
clearly
because
of
the
wealth
and
influence
he
family
have
and
connection
with
the
judge
and
you
know
I
certainly
do
not
justify
that
I
do
not
think
Affluenza
defense
be
a
decent
defense
I
use
the
term
more
in
a
sociological
way
in
society
this
as
you
say
be
a
extreme
case
what
be
the
hallmark
lack
of
consequence
I
think
hallmark
be
the
goal
in
life
to
be
material
to
have
as
much
stuff
as
possible
you
see
it
in
a
societal
basis
the
idea
we
have
to
have
the
grossest
domestic
product
most
money
he
who
die
with
the
most
toy
win
the
concept
that
the
aim
in
life
be
forever
more
stuff
this
be
a
disease
a
sickness
I
think
it
have
spread
quite
a
bit
through
society
and
he
represent
a
extreme
case
of
that
he
represent
the
fact
that
if
you
have
a
lot
of
money
in
society
you
can
avoid
consequence
and
maybe
even
a
better
example
would
be
the
banker
who
speculate
away
all
kind
of
fund
prior
to
the
financial
crisis
in
2008
use
other
people
money
and
yet
not
a
single
one
of
those
have
go
to
jail
yet
to
my
knowledge
you
be
right
on
that
back
to
the
couch
the
move
by
Ethan
where
he
be
try
to
avoid
deportation
from
Mexico
to
the
try
to
stay
in
a
mexican
jail
what
do
you
think
about
that
well
sometimes
hear
about
mexican
jail
maybe
it
would
be
nice
if
he
have
to
spend
a
little
time
there
to
reflect
on
what
have
happen
the
real
question
here
be
somebody
have
to
be
hold
responsible
if
Ethan
couch
have
Affluenza
no
sense
of
consequence
for
any
of
these
thing
because
he
be
not
bring
up
to
know
right
or
wrong
why
be
he
parent
not
prosecute
why
do
not
somebody
do
jail
time
for
the
horrific
crime
of
essentially
murder
four
people
with
be
this
sort
of
typical
I
mean
you
have
the
proprietor
of
this
strip
club
follow
ethan
couch
back
to
he
hotel
so
mommy
can
pay
for
he
strip
club
bar
tab
which
be
--
I
mean
that
be
something
else
right
this
really
close
mother-son
relationship
be
that
something
that
be
typical
in
these
case
of
Affluenza
that
you
have
study
I
do
not
know
because
I
have
not
think
of
it
as
much
in
a
very
psychological
sense
I
have
think
of
it
more
as
a
social
disease
as
I
mention
but
it
do
seem
that
this
kind
of
enable
on
the
part
of
parent
and
particularly
rich
parent
and
I
do
not
want
to
by
that
suggest
that
all
rich
parent
treat
they
kid
that
way
sure
I
do
not
think
that
be
the
case
at
all
but
in
this
case
it
be
clear
you
can
not
make
this
stuff
up
this
be
such
a
extreme
case
oh
unfortunately
--
oh
bummer
I
think
we
just
lose
he
satellite
signal
we
be
wrap
that
up
but

of
it

low

can
be
apply
to
Hillary
I
just
do
not
like
to
use
the
same
thing
twice
on
one
of
my
enemy
right
because
I
consider
they
enemy
we
view
this
as

do
not
we
view
this
as
war
it
be
war
last
week
she
be

I
really
hard
with
the
woman
card
okay
really
hard
and
I
have
to
say
okay
that
be
enough
that
be
enough
and
we
do
a
strong
number
she
be
not
go
to
win
by
the
way
I
love
the
concept
I
love
love
love
have
a
woman
president
can
not
be
she
she
be
horrible
Obama

not
want
to
hit
they
too
hard
because
he
be
afraid
he
be
go
to
pollute
the
atmosphere
Tis
be
serious
so
he
be
get
a
problem
with
the
carbon
footprint
you
can
not
use
hairspray
because
hairspray
be
go
to
affect
the
ozone
I
be
try
to
figure
out
let
see
I
be
in
my
room
in
New
York
City
and
I
want
to
put
a
little
spray
so
that
I
can
--
right
right
but
here
they
do
not
want
I
to
use
hairspray
they
want
I
to
use
the
pump
because
the
other
one
--
which
I
really
like
better
than
go
bing
bing
bing
and
then
it
come
out
in
big
glob
and
stick
in
you
hair
and
say
oh
my
God
I
have
to
take
a
shower
again
my
hair
all
screw
up
say
even
if
you
do
not
win
what
you
have
do
be
incredible
you
have
totally
change
the
landscape
of
politics
I
say
you
do
not
understand
you
do
not
understand
if
I
do
not
win
I
will
consider
this
and
I
mean
this
a
total
and
complete
waste
of
time
well
you
have
to
look
up
to
see
it
it
be
a
message
in
the
sky
above
the
Rose
parade
in
Pasadena
California
take
a
look
at
this
video
the
message
in
the
sky
read
quote
America
be
great
trump
be
disgusting
anybody
but
trump
Sky
Writers
dash
out
the
message
just
as
the
last
float
leave
the
gate
join
I
on
the
phone
we
have
CNN
correspondent
Sara
Sidner
in
Los
Angeles
I
know
you
be
there
at
the
parade
how
many
plane
do
it
take
to
create
this
message
in
the
sky
and
do
you
get
a
sense
from
anyone
about
how
they
be
respond
to
it
people
be
go
crazy
on
social
media
that
be
very
apparent
if
you
go
on
twitter
you
can
not
miss
it
at
this
point
a
lot
of
people
do
not
see
it
at
first
because
the
parade
as
you
mention
be
kind
of
come
to
its
end
but
the
parade
go
for
about
two
mile
somebody
tap
we
on
the
shoulder
and
say
what
be
go
on
and
we
look
up
in
the
sky
and
I
see
about
six
plane
and
at
first
they
be
fly
in
perfect
formation
I
think
that
maybe
it
be
military
plane
I
be
not
sure
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
see
it
spew
out
letter
and
I
think
what
be
it
go
to
say
and
then
the
message
come
you
mention
the
message
we
could
not
even
get
the
entire
message
in
a
picture
because
it
be
so
enormous
you
can
see
this
message
from
about
a
ten-mile
radius
and
of
course
it
dissipate
and
then
they
do
it
a
second
pass
they
do
it
a
second
time
so
you
could
see
it
while
drive
you
could
see
it
far
far
far
away
from
the
parade
it
be
pretty
impressive
to
a
lot
of
people
a
lot
of
people
try
to
figure
out
what
it
be
go
to
say
and
then
we
get
different
piece
from
different
people
send
we
tweet
say
oh
wait
here
be
the
rest
and
then
finally
you
could
see
the
whole
message
which
be
you
know
America
be
great
trump
be
disgusting
anybody
but
trump
we
also
go
online
Brianna
try
to
figure
out
where
this
come
from
who
be
the
group
behind
this
be
it
one
of
he
rival
or
a
super
pac
or
who
be
this
and
there
be
a
website
that
have
a
lot
of
the
same
message
on
that
website
so
we
be
wonder
if
there
be
some
correlation
but
have
not
hear
back
from
they
so
we
do
not
exactly
know
who
be
behind
this
but
maybe
some
clue
there
okay

happen
on
the
sabbath
with
cafe
be
full
a
normal
shopping
day
as
people
be
get
ready
to
go
home
to
they
family
for
dinner
exactly
right
and
this
be
a
time
--
this
be
a
very
busy
city
this
be
a
time
when
so
many
people
be
out
you
say
incredibly
that
people
leap
out
of
they
car
one
man
with
a
handgun
run
toward
the
scene
do
you
get
a
sense
how
this
that
no
one
be
able
to
follow
he
you
know
I
do
not
know
that
because
I
do
not
witness
the
gunman
but
exactly
what
you
say
do
happen
I
mean
in
front
of
we
a
car
pull
up
and
a
man
who
appear
to
be
a
civilian
who
know
if
he
be
former
police
officer
have
military
training
run
towards
the
scene
with
a
gun
that
he
pull
basically
out
of
the
back
of
he
shirt
and
you
know
I
speak
to
a
couple
witness
afterwards
who
see
it
but
it
seem
like
everyone
basically
hide
in
place
as
this
happen
so
I
be
not
able
to
talk
to
anyone
who
see
the
gunman
except
for
a
bartender
I
speak
to
tonight
he
be
order
some
food
quite
close
by
actually
see
the
gunman
but
he
run
in
the
opposite
direction
just
to
be
safe
he
recall
to
I
this
be
something
you
expect
in
some
certain
area
of
Israel
where
there
be
a
lot
of
conflict
where
you
might
have
violence
on
a
regular
basis
but
he
say
you
would
never
expect
to
see
this
in
the
middle
of
Tel
Aviv
especially
on
the
day
after
new
year
he
just
say
it
be
very
very
shocking
to
he
as
a
israeli
oh
it
be
very
shocking
I
be
actually
in
Tel
Aviv
this
last
year
and
it
be
a
place
where
you
feel
you
know
very
safe
you
can
not
say
that
about
certainly
all
place
in
Israel
it
be
a
area
where
there
be
conflict
but
this
be
a
place
where
you
know
people
be
just
enjoy
themselves
go
to
bar
go
to
restaurant
go
to
pub
like
this
one
anything
more
that
that
man
you
speak
with
say
about
the
gunman
no
he
do
not
say
anything
else
about
the
gunman
and
I
be
not
able
to
get
more
detail
from
he
because
he
seem
to
have
leave
the
scene
very
quickly
which
I
think
people
here
be
very
smart
people
who
feel
like
they
could
help
or
know
that
they
be
go
to
be
victim
run
towards
the
scene
and
people
who
want
to
stay
safe
either
sheltered
in
place
or
go
into
store
or
back
into
apartment
building
like
the
rest
of
we
do
but
tension
here
be
a
bit
high
just
a
few
day
ago
there
be
a
stab
attack
at
the
gate
in
Jerusalem
that
be
be
a
big
topic
of
conversation
among
Israelis
I
have
speak
to
here
I
think
this
be
only
go
to
add
to
the
tension
the
fact
that
this
person
this
assailant
have
not
be
capture
yet
and
be
still
on
the
loose
especially
with
a
large
amount
of
police
presence
in
Tel
Aviv
to
I
be
pretty
shocking
and
I
be
sure
quite
frightening
to
other
resident
in
the
area
in
Tel
Aviv
as
to
where
this
man
be
I
be
sure
it
be
Meg
Robertson
thank
you
so
muc
for
join
we
we
appreciate
you
tell
we
what
you
see
there
and
all
of
this
of
course
come
as
New
York
governor
Andrew
quo
mo
--
Cuomo
be
urge
people
to
be
vigilant
follow
the
arrest
of
a
Rochester
man
plan
to
attack
new
year
eve
reveler
with
a
machete
authority
say
he
be
in
contact
with
a
member
of
Isis
overseas
and
plan
he
attack
so
he
could
join
the
terror
group
himself
overseas
the
Taliban
claim
responsibility
for
a
different
actual
attack
here
a
suicide
bombing
at
a
french
restaurant
in
Afghanistan
capital
Kabul
it
be
a
area
very
popular
with
foreigner
there
a
12-year-old
boy
be
kill
in
that
attack
and
then
in
the
french
city
a
suspect
be
in
custody
after
he
try
to
run
over
soldier
let
bring
in
CNN
global
affair
analyst
and
daily
beast
contributor
Kimberly
dozier
it
be
really
striking
when
we
see
all
of
these
different
attack
happen
all
over
the
place
and
I
want
to
start
with
these
deadly
shooting
in
Tel
Aviv
today
do
you
see
this
in
a
way
as
part
of
a
new
wave
of
soft
target
where
lone
wolf
be
get
more
embolden
in
a
way
that
just
make
people
generally
feel
unsafe
go
about
they
sort
of
daily
routine
well
I
think
each
of
these
attack
have
something
to
do
with
local
grievance
combine
with
inspiration
by
the
Isis
militant
movement
and
method
that
some
of
its
follower
have
use
that
have
prove
very
effective
you
attack
in
Tel
Aviv
be
not
you
standard
palestinian
militant
attack
they
have
be
for
the
past
three
month
carry
out
almost
daily
attack
by
stab
or
with
car
but
somehow
this
man
get
ahold
of
a
automatic
weapon
and
accord
to
Israeli
news
report
he
have
a
quran
in
he
bag
he
be
upset
possibly
over
the
death
of
a
relative
at
the
hand
of
israeli
security
force
but
it
be
not
clear
what
motivate
he
what
it
do
look
like
though
be
that
he
copy
the
Paris
attackers
dress
all
in
black
use
a
automatic
weapon
and
go
to
a
place
like
the
center
where
this
happen
and
just
hit
multiple
target
where
people
be
less
than
prepare
for
this
kind
of
automatic
weapon
fire
so
that
be
what
you
have
they
find
in
this
bag
that
he
leave
we
see
he
leave
this
on
the
shopping
cart
in
what
look
like
a
market
that
he
have
a
quran
in
that
that
be
in
multiple
local
israeli
news
report
that
I
have
not
yet
be
able
to
verify
but
they
also
have
report
of
a
relative
of
this
alleged
attacker
have
identify
he
in
say
that
he
be
upset
over
the
loss
of
a
relative
at
the
hand
of
israeli
security
force
this
be
all
part
of
the
first
report
but
it
seem
to
indicate
that
this
man
attack
because
of
a
local
grievance
yet
he
use
method
that
we
be
begin
to
see
again
and
again
because
of
Isis
yeah
let
talk
about
this
Rochester
case
here
Emanuel
Lutchman
arrest
for
reportedly
he
be
plan
a
attack
on
new
year
reveler
which
end
up
effect
celebration
there
in
Rochester
so
undercover
informant
be
a
big
part
of
this
investigation
some
of
they
be
reportedly
pay
several
thousand
dollar
by
the
government
do
that
do
anything
in
effect
the
case
against
this
man
it
do
raise
a
question
when
you
look
at
the
individual
himself
and
ask
what
mean
do
he
have
of
carry
out
attack
on
behalf
of
Isis
possibly
yes
he
be
radicalize
by
they
by
outreach
online
but
then
it
look
like
from
the
way
the
court
papers
describe
it
that
the
FBI
step
in
and
enable
this
man
through
these
informant
make
ing
WEAPO
available
to
he
and
possibly
conspiree
to
make
this
video
confession
before
carry
something
out
would
he
have
just
stay
a
sort
of
fan
in
the
background
without
this
encouragement
that
be
really
not
clear
but
civil
rights
activist
in
similar
case
to
this
have
say
you
be
enable
people
who
never
would
have
take
up
arm
against
another
person
if
you
do
not
make
it
possible
for
they
to
do
it
yeah

right

cosby
wife
of
52
year
will
be
depose
by
the
attorney
of
the
seven
accuser
who
be
sue
the
comic
legend
for
defamation
this
be
under
a
Massachusetts
judge
order
they
lawsuit
say
cosby
call
they
liar
for
they
sex
assault
claim
against
he
and
Cosby
have
countersue
say
the
seven
woman
hurt
he
reputation
derail
he
plan
for
a
comedy
show
on
NBC
in
the
last
hour
the
womens
attorney
tell
I
why
he
want
to
depose
Camille
Cosby
she
have
information
that
be
relevant
to
the
issue
in
this
case
for
example
he
relationship
that
he
be
have
with
other
woman
he
sexual
proclivity
he
use
of
quaaludes
she
be
as
you
correctly
point
out
he
business
manager
clearly
as
a
business
manager
she
will
have
information
as
to
what
impact
if
any
these
woman
have
on
he
business
COSBY
now
out
on
a
million
dollar
bail
just
two
day
ago
he
be
charge
with
sexual
assault
in
Montgomery
County
Pennsylvania
the
alleged
victim
in
this
case
be
not
part
of
this
other
lawsuit
just
to
be
clear
about
that
today
Cosby
tweet
this
he
say
friend
and
fan
thank
you
with
I
now
criminal
defense
attorney
Trent
Copeland
and
Darren
Kavanoki
Darren
clear
this
up
for
we
because
a
lot
of
people
would
think
how
can
a
wife
testify
against
she
husband
well
she
may
not
be
able
to
testify
at
trial
but
in
the
context
of
the
deposition
--
she
be
certainly
fair
game
for
this
deposition
because
she
may
lead
to
the
discovery
of
other
relevant
admissible
evidence
and
so
you
have
get
to
look
at
this
in
the
context
of
where
we
be
in
the
case
we
be
still
very
much
in
pretrial
discovery
where
the
rule
be
very
broad
in
favor
of
she
testify
whether
or
not
she
can
get
on
the
stand
at
trial
that
be
another
matter
entirely
and
that
be
where
there
be
a
lot
more
protection
one
spouse
and
the
other
okay
so
Trent
this
be
in
the
discovery
phase
what
kind
of
thing
could
Camille
cosby
reveal
in
a
deposition
that
--
basically
this
would
kind
of
give
the
prosecution
more
thread
to
pull
right
what
might
those
thread
be
yeah
remember
and
Brianna
this
be
not
the
prosecution
this
be
a
civil
case
so
this
be
go
to
be
a
civil
lawyer
yeah
what
that
lawyer
be
really
try
to
find
out
Brianna
be
whether
or
not
Cosby
understand
Cosby
use
quaaludes
whether
or
not
he
have
certain
sexual
proclivity
the
truth
be
I
do
not
think
there
be
much
she
be
go
to
be
able
to
provide
do
not
expect
Camille
Cosby
to
say
oh
yeah
I
be
aware
my
husband
be
have
rampant
affair
with
50
60
some
odd
woman
do
not
expect
she
to
say
I
be
aware
my
husband
be
take
quaaludes
and
give
they
to
woman
or
that
I
be
provide
he
with
those
kind
of
drug
do
not
expect
that
I
really
do
not
think
this
sort
of
fishing
expedition
that
the
lawyer
for
these
seven
allege
accuser
be
indicate
I
really
do
not
think
this
be
go
to
lead
to
much
I
really
do
not
but
in
the
capacity
of
she
job
as
bill
Cosby
business
manager
it
may
be
--
there
may
be
some
relevance
in
term
of
what
she
can
provide
remember
he
be
countersue
he
be
say
they
allegation
hurt
he
business
and
she
capacity
as
a
business
manager
she
may
be
able
to
shed
some
light
with
regard
to
that
I
want
to
listen
now
to
this
clip
the
attorney
for
the
woman
sue
Cosby
say
the
detail
in
it
about
a
drug
call
Spanish
fly
be
very
important
to
he
case
against
Cosby
know
what
it
be
the
spanish
fly
be
the
thing
that
all
boy
from
age
11
on
up
to
death
we
will
still
be
search
for
spanish
fly
that
be
right
and
what
be
the
old
story
the
old
story
be
if
you
take
a
little
drop
no
it
be
on
the
head
of
a
--
pin
pin
COCA-COLA
do
not
matter
and
the
girl
would
drink
it
and
--
she
be
yours
hello
America
let
talk
about
this
Trent
in
the
case
of
--
I
know
right
it
be
hard
I
have
watch
that
so
many
time
it
be
hard
to
watch
in
the
context
of
what
be
go
on
right
now
let
talk
about
the
criminal
case
not
the
seven
woman
but
the
case
involve
Andrea
Constand
in
Pennsylvania
be
this
something
that
prosecutor
you
would
expect
would
use
would
this
be
one
of
the
more
damning
piece
of
evidence
well
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
go
to
be
damning
but
I
think
it
be
certainly
harmful
and
damaging
that
be
for
sure
you
know
look
Bill
cosby
have
this
sort
of
you
know
part
of
he
comedy
routine
over
the
year
--
look
remember
this
be
not
the
only
time
Larry
King
interview
that
he
express
interest
in
spanish
fly
he
have
it
in
some
of
he
standup
routine
the
problem
be
it
demonstrate
Brianna
I
think
you
question
be
a
good
one
because
look
be
this
a
guy
who
have
this
routinely
part
of
he
be
this
part
of
what
he
do
he
like
to
give
woman
thing
and
drug
they
and
put
they
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
and
take
advantage
of
they
and
he
do
that
so
openly
he
do
it
that
he
would
even
make
it
part
of
he
comedy
routine
part
of
he
standup
routine
I
think
it
be
a
problem
I
think
it
be
something
that
he
be
get
to
deal
with
Darren
if
I
can
just
amplify
something
here
there
be
a
huge
distinction
between
cosby
be
convict
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
where
I
think
there
be
fairly
unanimous
agreement
that
he
be
engage
in
some
really
horrific
behavior
but
you
have
get
to
distinguish
between
that
and
what
a
prosecutor
able
to
prove
in
a
court
of
law
and
the
prosecutor
get
the
burden
to
prove
there
be
something
specific
that
happen
on
a
specific
night
and
you
also
have
to
remember
Brianna
that
this
be
a
case
that
be
review
by
a
prosecutor
a
decade
ago
and
reject
as
have
insufficient
evidence
and
so
they
better
be
able
to
come
to
the
table
and
show
thing
be
now
different
and
it
be
not
just
that
the
sea
of
public
opinion
have
turn
against
Cosby
but
that
they
actually
have
evidence
to
meet
they
burden
because
they
be
the
only
one
in
the
courtroom
that
have
one
they
have
get
to
prove
he
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
do
something
specific
at
a
specific
time
and
not
just
be
a
horrific
human
being
all
right
Trent
and
Darren
you
be
go
to
stick
around
we
be
go
to
see
you
back
here
in
just
a
bit
and
we
will
talk
more
I
promise
gentleman
but
next
a
big
shakeup
at
the
very
top
of
the
Ben
Carson
campaign
just
a
month
before
the
Iowa
caucus
hear
what
he
new
campaign
chairman
tell
I
about
the
strategy
move
forward
plus
smoke
be
still
visible
at
the
Dubai
hotel
that
be
the
scene
of
a
raging
fire
yesterday
on
new
year
eve
a
harrowing
survival
story
of
a
man
who
be
about
to
repel
from
the
48th
floor
when
firefighter
rescue
he
we
will
have
that
let
turn
now
to
the
race
for
2016
Ben
Carson
be
kick
off
the
new
year
with
a
major
campaign
shakeup
five
staffer
abruptly
resign
in
the
past
two
day
this
include
he
communication
director
and
he
campaign
manager
and
he
deputy
campaign
manager
as
well
just
a
couple
hour
ago
I
speak
with
retire
Army
Major
General
Robert
Dees
he
be
now
take
over
as
the
campaign
chairman
there
be
be
maybe
a
false
narrative
that
the
campaign
be
in
chaos
or
the
campaign
be
lose
momentum
it
be
just
the
opposite
we
be
gain
energy
and
this
change
have
help
we
to
gain
that
energy
we
have
have
a
policy
engine
that
be
idle
we
be
go
to
take
the
governor
off
of
that
and
allow
people
of
America
to
really
see
what
Ben
Carson
believe
about
certain
thing
we
have
have
a
communication
strategy
that
be
passive
instead
of
active
we
be
go
to
change
that
immediately
we
be
in
fact
stand
up
a
entire
policy
direct
and
bring
in
new
player
that
have
expert
in
they
field
world
class
expert
and
we
be
excite
about
that
well
let
bring
in
now
CNN
investigation
correspondent
Chris
frates
passive
instead
of
active
can
a
restaff
reenergize
the
interview
be
a
prime
example
this
campaign
kind
of
in
damage
control
mode
t
they
be
try
to
convince
everybody
this
be
routine
one
of
Carson
adviser
say
yesterday
Reagan
change
he
staff
up
right
before
the
New
Hampshire
primary
we
be
certainly
not
in
a
tail
spin
here
but
as
you
hear
you
be
bring
in
a
foreign
policy
expert
because
Ben
Carson
have
some
trouble
with
foreign
policy
you
know
one
of
he
biggest
guest
of
course
be
pronounce
Hamas
like
Humus
Carson
himself
say
we
do
a
deep
dive
and
find
there
be
some
deficiency
well
that
be
pretty
obvious
I
think
the
trouble
for
Carson
be
go
to
be
convincing
voter
now
that
they
have
see
the
deficiency
that
he
can
in
fact
overcome
that
that
be
different
than
sell
a
vision
forward
he
need
to
now
convince
they
that
he
can
do
the
job
that
be
go
to
be
a
tougher
sell
for
the
Carson
people
I
think
Brianna
it
be
interesting
talk
to
dee
basically
it
be
exactly
what
you
say
try
to
say
this
be
routine
and
I
ask
he
okay
I
mean
campaign
manager
comm
director
deputy
campaign
manager
go
and
people
look
at
that
and
say
chaos
and
you
say
that
be
a
misread
and
he
say
yes
what
do
you
think
about
that
I
mean
I
think
that
be
exactly
what
they
be
try
to
say
and
you
hear
he
say
well
we
be
go
to
pump
up
policy
we
be
go
to
bring
in
very
smart
new
voice
and
it
be
interesting
I
be
talk
to
Armstrong
Williams
yesterday
and
he
be
one
of
--
he
be
Carson
business
manager
and
he
be
a
outside
adviser
he
have
no
official
role
inside
the
campaign
but
a
really
influential
adviser
I
say
be
you
bring
dee
in
because
he
be
a
foreign
policy
adviser
to
the
campaign
be
that
helpful
to
you
and
he
say
you
know
it
be
a
bonus
but
what
dee
bring
be
a
lot
of
organization
and
get
the
best
out
of
people
so
I
think
there
be
a
feeling
inside
the
campaign
that
they
be
not
organize
enough
that
they
be
not
high
octane
enough
and
that
they
do
not
take
this
hit
and
bounce
back
he
continue
to
make
foreign
policy
blunder
and
now
they
need
to
kind
of
restaff
very
quickly
I
mean
they
only
have
about
a
month
here
so
I
think
it
be
go
to
be
tough
for
they
to
do
this
but
certainly
they
have
really
shake
thing
up
and
they
be
go
with
a
new
team
in
the
new
year
here
yeah
we
will
have
to
see
if
it
make
the
difference
who
know

when

sweep

she
start
just
scream
she
scream
and
scream
and
scream
she
phone
go
blank
he
track
she
with
a
app
on
he
phone
rush
through
the
scene
break
through
the
police
line
and
find
she
I
grab
she
start
talk
to
she
I
say
Petra
wake
up
Petra
die
in
that
car
one
of
eight
life
take

Garland
and
I
grab
she
wrist
to
see
if
she
have
a
pulse
but
she
be
go
she
be
just
go
I
mean
and
then
I
start
scream
tell
everybody
I
need
help
over
here
my
wife
in
the
car
if
you
would
like
to
help
the
flood
victim
you
can
go
to
CNN
impact
you
world
website
we
do
have
link
there
to
vet
organization
on
the
ground
in
Missouri
that
be
at
impact
the
Freddie
Gray
case
in
Baltimore
be
near
a
crucial
phase
question
about
gray
health
be
be
raise
just
ten
day
before
the
trial
begin
for
the
police
officer
who
drive
the
van
where
gray
be
fatally
injure
defense
attorney
for
officer
Cesar
goodson
claim
gray
complain
of
back
problem
week
before
he
get
in
the
van
and
suffer
a
spinal
injury
last
April
the
defense
cite
a
recently
unsealed
document
that
state
gray
allegedly
mention
he
back
pain
when
he
meet
with
Baltimore
police
less
than
two
week
before
he
arrest
join
I
again
Darren
Kavinoky
and
defense
attorney
Trent
Copeland
so
Darren
tell
we
how
be
this
unsealed
police
document
go
to
hold
up
in
court
yeah
I
be
not
sure
how
much
mileage
they
be
go
to
get
from
this
but
it
be
very
interesting
Brianna
because
it
open
up
a
whole
slew
of
issue
so
this
all
arise
from
a
interview
that
Freddie
Gray
give
to
police
officer
week
before
he
die
which
show
that
he
be
work
as
a
undercover
informant
or
somehow
be
know
to
police
in
help
they
on
these
other
case
and
the
idea
be
that
he
make
sort
of
a
offhanded
remark
about
he
back
be
injure
there
be
a
note
that
be
make
in
a
report
but
that
report
be
not
even
generate
until
week
after
he
death
so
there
be
some
really
funny
stuff
in
all
of
this
chronology
but
ultimately
here
where
this
come
down
if
there
be
evidence
that
be
exculpatory
mean
it
help
the
defense
it
should
be
turn
over
and
they
should
have
the
opportunity
to
explore
it
I
do
not
know
that
they
be
go
to
get
so
much
mileage
from
this
bad
back
because
if
you
will
remember
Freddie
Gray
be
run
from
officer
at
the
scene
and
that
be
what
invite
they
attention
in
the
first
place
I
be
not
sure
how
bad
he
back
really
be
but
ultimately
you
do
not
want
to
have
to
do
a
trial
twice
and
so
the
material
should
be
explore
fully
by
the
defense
Trent
the
defense
team
they
want
access
to
gray
medical
record
do
you
think
that
be
something
the
judge
will
grant
well
I
do
I
think
the
judge
be
go
to
grant
it
because
the
judge
do
not
want
to
be
overturn
on
appeal
I
think
Darren
right
in
the
sense
that
the
defense
be
look
for
information
regard
Freddie
Gray
back
and
back
problem
be
remind
of
this
he
do
not
die
as
a
result
of
have
a
break
back
he
die
as
a
result
of
have
a
broken
neck
and
that
broken
neck
take
place
as
a
result
of
he
be
throw
about
allegedly
in
that
van
back
and
forth
so
look
I
think
the
judge
be
go
to
go
overboard
I
think
he
be
go
to
allow
the
exculpatory
evidence
if
it
exist
if
it
be
provide
to
the
defense
I
think
he
be
go
to
make
sure
it
be
provide
to
they
in
its
entirety
I
think
the
judge
want
to
be
careful
because
he
want
to
make
sure
that
the
defense
get
a
fair
trial
in
the
end
Brianna
I
be
not
sure
any
of
it
matter
I
think
at
the
heart
of
this
case
what
the
defense
be
try
to
establish
be
look
Freddie
Gray
have
a
pre-existing
problem
have
a
pre-existing
medical
condition
it
be
a
bad
back
as
a
result
they
will
try
to
bring
in
some
sort
of
expert
witness
that
say
hey
look
that
batd
back
contribute
to
he
inability
to
control
himself
when
he
be
in
the
back
of
that
van
and
that
be
really
what
cause
this
neck
injury
ordinary
person
in
ordinary
situation
would
not
have
have
the
same
problem
I
be
not
sure
it
be
go
to
fly
I
agree
with
Darren
but
I
think
they
will
explore
it
just
to
try
to
create
some
doubt
there
so
Darren
what
about
the
medical
examiner
who
perform
the
autopsy
and
testify
she
do
not
find
any
sign
of
a
previous
back
or
neck
injury
how
do
that
factor
in
here
right
well
ultimately
it
become
a
tale
of
two
narrative
and
the
jury
be
go
to
be
task
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
of
decide
which
be
the
more
credible
likely
version
at
the
end
of
the
day
while
I
think
that
the
defense
will
get
to
fully
explore
this
issue
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
not
to
allow
they
to
I
do
not
think
that
this
will
be
the
thing
that
turn
the
case
but
you
never
know
and
that
be
why
as
much
as
pundit
like
Trent
and
I
may
like
to
opine
from
the
sideline
you
get
to
play
the
game
on
the
field
and
ultimately
it
be
go
to
be
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
you
agree
with
that
Trent
maybe
this
be
not
the
win
strategy
I
do
not
know
that
it
be
the
win
strategy
but
look
let
remember
this
there
be
initially
a
hung
jury
in
that
first
case
so
win
can
be
define
a
number
of
way
I
think
at
this
point
the
prosecution
not
win
and
the
defense
be
so
look
any
time
there
be
a
hung
jury
any
time
the
defense
get
a
verdict
that
be
anything
other
than
guilty
the
defense
be
win
so
I
think
they
will
explore
this
they
will
try
to
make
hay
with
it
I
think
they
will
try
to
move
forward
but
in
the
end
I
do
not
think
it
be
the
win
strategy
gentleman
thank
you
so
much
for
chat
with
I
I
do
appreciate
it
and
next
they

we
have
some
flooding
on
the
outer
reach
of
both

foot
come

Lutchman
hope
to

and
tell
a
FBI
informant
quote
if
we
grab

the

say
three
agent

tell
he
he
bar
be
the
plan
location
of
the
attack
he
have
be
around
the
neighborhood
for
quite
some
time
he
be
a
panhandler
and
a
lot
of
the

have
ask

he
have
be
to
a
few
of
they
now
what
make
this
case
stand
out
from

of
0
the
other
story
we

be
that
Lutchman
claim

Isis
overseas
now
that
be
a
direction
he
say
he
receive
that
be
different
from
all
of
these
other
arrest
we
have
see
where
people
say
they
be
simply
inspire
by
propaganda
they
would
see

December
Washington
dc
Los
Angeles
New

in

the
people
who
go
to
that
bar
merchant
listen
to
what

could
not
imagine
a

the

stand
behind
the
decision

--
bur
j

the
world
toldest
building
John
what
be
folk
say
about
how
this
be
handle
well
Gregg
emergency
crew
that
be
really
be
credit
for
save
the
life
of
thousand
of
people
during
the
building
evacuation
and
during
the
interview
of
witness
they
be
laud
those
emergency
crew
and
security
personnel
for
keep
thing
calm
and
orderly
despite
this
incredible
situation
with
the
fire
also
the
country
prime
minister
today
say
that
he
be
proud
of
the

and
as
you

only
14
minor

one
person
be
MoD
latry
injure
and
another
suffer
a

but
that
be
not

again
the
huge
firework
celebration
go
on
as
plan
outside
the
Burj
Khalifa
the
world
tallest
skyscraper
that
loom
over
the
address
hotel
where
this
fire
erupt
and
continue
as
plan
so
far
Gregg
there
be
really
be
no
criticism
of
that
because
it
be
already
a
huge
logistics
logistics
and
security
operation
so
they
get
people
out
quickly
fire
this
big
tend
to
smolder
for
a
very
very
long
time
and
there
can
be
flareup
just
dangerous
what
be
they
do
to
avoid
that
well
throughout
the
day
and
after
thing
--
after
they
get
the
flame
under
control
and
the
actual
fire
what
have
be
go
on
be
the
cooling
operation
where
they
basically
let
the
ember
burn
out
and
they
get
to
the
area
--
they
hose
down
the
area
they
be
not
able
to
get
to
last
night
this
be
a
63-story
tower
and
the
problem
be
it
snake
up
the
side
of
the
building
they
do
not
have
hadder
to
get
up
there
to
the
higher
floor
so
they
have
to
let
the
fire
burn
itself
out
and
the
building
state-of-the-art
fire
defense
system
to
do
its
job
the
building
be
open
in
2008
so
it
be
relatively
new
now
the
cause
be
under
investigation
it
remain
unknown
but
Dubai
media
office
be
call
it
a
accident
so
at
this
point
obviously
the
question
on
all
of
we
mind
could
this
be
terror
relate
and
at
this
point
that
do
not
appear
to
be
the
case
but
certainly
how
quickly
it
spread
snake
up
the
side
of
the
building
definitely
something
that
be
go
to
be
look
at
very
hard

people
think
the

would
not
stay
so
long
so
people
be
save
that
money
now
MasterCard
report
people
be
start

people
be
go
to
continue
to
save
money
on

and
they
will
start
to
feel
better
about

it
actually
spend
it
at

you
hear
all
these
pundit
say
2016
anywhere
from
one
percent
rise
to
a
negative
to
a
plus
eight
percent
nobody
know
nobody
know

there
be
always
these

word
I
love
hearing
volatility
stock
hit

high
and
then
drop
we
do
not
know
it
be
a
open
book
we
will
probably
still
see
weakness
in
the
commodity
market
strength
in
technology
but
it
be
anyone
guess
the
Fed
have
some
confidence
absolutely
they
raise
finally
interest
rate
that
be
zero
yes
so
now
they
raise
they
a
quarter
point
that
not
a
huge
difference
but
it
be
a
step
say
that
they
be
confident
that
the
economy
be
on
a
good
track
they
be
watch
datum
watch
what
be
go
on
outside
we
border
Europe
China
but
we
do
expect
they
to
continue
to
raise
rate
the
question
be
at
what
pace
and
how
much
probably
be
pretty
conservative
though
so
we
do
not
expect
huge
change

recognize
that
there
be
some
area
of
deficiency
have
say
that
must
recognize
that
the

that
we
have
take
a
very
unlikely
scenario
complete
outsider
and
put
he
into
a
competitive
position
where
nobody
think
that
be
even
remotely
possible
Fox

get
the

I
think

get
out
there
again

Senator
Ted
Cruz
take
in
about
$
45
million
rich
Edson
live
in
Washington
thank
you
Kaitlin
be
here
national
political
reporter
for
real
clear
politics
good
to
see
you
you
too
you
hear
trump
say
to
Fox
News
last
night
quote
have
a
very
big
lead
and
we
intend
to
keep
it
he
do
not
have
a
very
big
lead
in
Iowa
which
be
the
first
contest
let
put
up
you
real
clear
politics
poll
average
Ted
Cruz
actually
have
the
lead
by
nearly
three
point
and
the
trend
seem
to
be
grow
for
he
if
trump
actually
lose
Iowa
could
that
change
the
dynamic
of
the
campaign
and
have
a
dramatic
impacket
on
the
contest
to
--
impact
on
the
contest
to
follow
well
New
Hampshire
be
next
and
if
trump
do
not
win
Iowa
and
come
in
second
or
maybe
even
third
think
he
will
refocus
on
that
key
state
of
New
Hampshire
where
he
be
in
the
lead
by
a
significant
margin
but
remember
Donald
Trump
campaign
be
really
base
on
the
idea
of
win
so
I
think
that
not
do
--
not
come
in
first
--
what
be
he
go
to
stay
--
all
all
this
time
I
be
a
winner
I
be
a
have
a
very
big
lead
I
be
go
to
win
because
I
he
a
very
big
lead
and
if
the
louvrese
the
first
state
--
exactly
that
could
be
a
blow
I
if
we
know
anything
about
DONALD
TRUMP
he
will
repackage
it
make
it
sound
like
a
winner
but
it
would
be
a
big
blow
I
think
Ben
Carson
big
blow
lose
top
two
guy
just
a
month
before
the
first
caucus
vote
here
I
be
look
at
the
real
clear
politics
poll
average
he
be
in
October
at
24
%
boy
that
have
take
nosedive
now
to
nine
percent
can
he
recover
or
be
this
--
put
a
fork
in
he
campaign
I
think
it
be
very
difficult
at
this
point
anytime
you
have
a
reshuffling
of
the
campaign
it
say
something
about
you
candidacy
to
have
it
happen
this
close
to
when
voter
be
actually
go
to
start
voting
I
think
be
significant
now
I
do
think
that
he
can
do
okay
in
Iowa
he
do
have
that
kind
of
base
of
evangelical
supporter
but
remember
Ted
Cruz
have
really
inherit
a
lot
of
Ben
Carson
support
in
that
key
state
of
Iowa
be
well-organize
thread
and
also
the
southern
state
start
March
1st
you
have
have
few
people
drop
out
but
still
have
11
so
it
be
a
crowded
field
still
be
it
go
to
be
winnow
down
after
the
first
primary
after
the
first
actual
primary
the
second
state
to
cast
ballot
there
be
so
many
candidate
stake
they
entire
campaign
on
New
Hampshire
Chris
Christie
John
Kashich
Jeb
Bush
they
have
to
have
really
solid
showing
in
that
state
to
be
able
to
continue
so
I
do
thing
after
New
Hampshire
which
be
a
voting
state
not
a
caucus
which
be
important
so
I
think
after
that
we
will
see
a
winnowing
of
the
field
head
into
South
Carolina
Hillary
Clinton
really
good
another
make
money
she
--
as
we
mention
she
shatter
the
latest
fundraising
record
announce
she
raise
55
million
in
the
last
quarter
make
112
million
for
the
year
it
be
remarkable
especially
since
she
do
not
have
a
really
strong
primary
challenge
right
now
Bernie
Sanders
be
do
well
in
New
Hampshire
but
she
still
maintain
a
significant
lead
--
look
at
that
--
Ted
Cruz
be
half
of
much
as
she
and
Ben
Carson
54
they
be
not
even
close
well
again
use
mention
earlier
the
field
be
so
crowded
and
so
ted
Cruz
have
ratess
a
significant
amount
of
money
and
so
have
Ben
Carson
but
Ben
Carson
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
raise
money
so
we
raul
see
this
be
go
to
be
a
very
expensive
campaign
and
it
be
go
to
be
a
interesting
one
just
a
month
from
now
the
first
caucus
and
thing
be
always
change
in
Iowa
you
never
know
what
be
go
to
happen
of
course
always
room
for
a
surprise

also
write

doom

ambassador
great
to

to
you
it
seem
like
we
live
under
this
chronic
sort
of
phalanx
mentality
of
be
under
threat
of
terror
in
that
way
I
suppose
the
islamic
state
Isis
prevail
certainly
that
be
they
intent
one
of
the
way
they
create
a
impression
that
in
fact
they
be
have
a
impact
and
succeed
be
by
create
a
constant
sense
of
people
be
on
edge
constantly
have
to
pay
attention
to
they
and
every
time
they
suffer
a
setback
as
they
have
in
Ramadi
they
want
to
create
a
impression
that
in
fact
they
really
have
not
lose
they
be
still
there
they
be
succeed
by
keep
the
world
on
edge
and
that
in
fact
be
try
to
create
a
kind
of
polarization
of
the
world
against
they
because
they
have
a
apocalyptic
presentation
of
who
they
be
they
say
they
have
a
divine
mandate
but
they
look
for
a
end
of
day
see
narrow
and
right
now
they
want
to
coop
the
world
on
edge
you
say
we
can
not
discredit
isis
only
sunny
muss
--
sunny
Muslims
in
Iraq
what
do
youown
mean
I
man
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
can
set
back
Isis
we
can
militarily
ensure
they
lose
territory
but
they
claim
ill
that
they
have
a
divine
mandate
they
offer
a
pure
form
of
Islam
they
represent
the
perfect
of
Islam
no
nonmuslim
be
go
to
be
able
to
discredit
that
it
will
take
Muslims
to
do
that
they
view
shia
Muslims
as
not
be
Muslims
at
all
so
it
take
Sunnis
other
Sunnis
to
say
no
they
do
not
have
a
divine
mandate
no
they
do
not
represent
Islam
they
represent
a
perversion
of
Islam
have
we
say
that
will
have
no
impact
play
to
they
narrative
Syria
would
be
vital
it
be
critical
because
in
a
sense
Isis
--
if
you
look
at
where
the
real
capital
of
Isis
be
they
success
be
take
Mosul
but
where
they
be
rule
as
a
slosh
call
islamic
state
with
a
capital
be
raqqa
in
Syria
and
unless
you
basically
defeat
they
there
and
unless
you
force
they
out
of
raqqa
it
be
go
to
be
very
difficult
to
claim
the
islamic
state
have
truly
lose
but
it
be
very
difficult
in
a
sense
to
succeed
in
Syria
if
you
do
not
have
the
Sunnis
with
you
and
right
now
when
we
hit
isis
harder
but
the
Russians
be
hit
he
nonisis
sunni

and
over
the

we
be
go

go
through
all
of
they
start
with
the
best
and
worst
in
the
world
of
big
news
it
be
a
year
of
first
I
think
a
lot
of
people
who
predict
a
lot
of
thing
be
wrong
I
can
not
believe
it
be
the
end
of
the
year
already
it
be
be
weird
some
weird
stuff
happen
kind
of
horrifying
in
term
of
some
headline
the
worst
way
to
start
come
in
the
first
few
day
of
January
with
the
terror
attack
on
the
french
paper
Charlie
Hebdo
add
in
the
attack
on
Paris
later
--
--
and
indeed
around
the
world
and
you
get
the
worst
story
of
the
year
the
persistent
plague
of
terrorism
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
be
deal
here
with
a
very
different
beast
something
we
have
not
see
before
something
which
do
not
follow
any
form
of
normal
social
norm
or
even
by
the
perversion
of
terrorism
this
be
absolutely
out
of
the
pale
you
feel
hopeless
you
feel
scared
and
all
you
can
do
be
post
a
picture
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
inside
a
peace
sign
and
post
its
on
instagram
what
else
do
you
do
the
official
response
to
Isis
more
than
coalition
air
strike
since
they
begin
last
year
include
one
that
official
say
kill
the
infamous
Jihadi
John
and
the
best
personal
reaction
to
it
all

that

vicious
assault
come
closer
to
home
too
Mass
shooting
rock
a
school
in
Oregon
a
planned
parenthood
clinic
in
Colorado
and
many
other
place
include
San
Bernardino
California
where
a
shooting
at
a
office
gathering
as
the
year
wind
down
reignite
fear
of
domestic
terrorism
any
time
that
you
hear
about
like
a
mass
shooting
whether
it
be
a
school
or
church
it
be
like
really
really
sad
because
it
go
to
show
you
that
sometimes
you
be
not
in
control
in
Charleston
South
Carolina
a
massacre
at
a
church
prayer
meeting
strike
many
people
very
hard
but
what
be
so
uplifting
and
amazing
actually
be
I
be
go
to
say
they
faith
and
action
that
congregation
afterward
amaze
--
huh-uh
--
zing
grace
how
sweet
the
sound
most
graceful
move
in
the
aftermath
the
relatively
swift
step
by
South
Carolina
to
bow
to
pressure
and
take
the
rebel
flag
off
of
permanent
official
display
that
feel
like
one
of
those
like
the
problem
come
up
we
ban
it
it
be
over
with
and
as
a
society
it
feel
like
we
be
like
next
next
problem
not
exactly
this
year
the
worst
domestic
problem
that
seem
almost
unsolvable
racial
tension
hand
up
do
not
shoot
what
we
be
hear
again
and
again
from
the
african-american
community
be
they
do
not
feel
as
if
they
be
be
treat
equally
or
with
the
respect
by
law
enforcement
as
everyone
else
in
Baltimore
the
death
of
a
black
man
in
police
custody
set
off
day
of
unrest
other
case
in
other
place
follow
many
of
they
shocking
and
poll
now
show
almost
half
of
all
Americans
think
race
be
a
big
problem
that
be
a
20-year
high
hand
up
do
not
shoot
and
as
police
inquiry
mount
there
need
to
be
more
than
just
lay
people
off
suspend
without
pay
more
than
that
that
be
not
enough
because
they
need
to
be
make
a
example
out
of
and
they
need
to
fear
the
repercussion
of
treat
people
as
though
they
be
not
human
being
the
worst
backlash
police
officer
seemingly
be
target
shoot
at
and
in
some
case
kill
when
that
happen
I
be
so
afraid
because
if
everyone
rebel
against
the
police
then
who
be
go
to
protect
we
worst
case
of
try
too
hard
to
empathize
the
white
woman
in
Spokane
who
pass
herself
off
as
black
with
a
local
chapter
of
the
NAACP
I
identify
as
black
she
say
I
be
like
there
be
no
way
this
be
real
this
story
be
not
real
they
get
a
woman
to
pose
for
these
picture
this
be
crazy
best
way
to
cool
everyone
off
or
worst
depend
on
how
you
see
it
the
crush

I
get
fear

I
understand
the
panic
of
we

not
let

we
do
not
have
time
to
determine
who
be
a
real

who
be
pretend
to
be
a
refugee
so
they
can
infiltrate
we

and
blow
stuff
up
but
you
know
I
think
that
that
be
what
we
country
be
kind
of
like
be
kind
of
all
about
be
give
opportunity
to
other
people

chaotic
with

roaring
candidate
fight
at
every
turn
and
a
democratic
process
that
look
more
like
a
demolition
derby
no
one
slam
into
the
headline
harder
than
Donald
trump
as
he
accelerate
into
the
race
with
explosive
pronouncement
about
mexican
immigrant
they
be
bring
drug
they
be
rapist

pump

Donald
Trump
have
prove
to
those
of
we
who
think
we
know
something
about
politics
wrong
every
step
of
the
way
I
think
that
we
be
now
only
begin
to
appreciate
the
anger
and
the
passion
among
the
electorate
which
be
something
that
trump
have
be
able
to
tap
into
meanwhile
fact
checkers
and
comedian
go
wild
this
be
a
year
where
the
Saturday
night
live
skit
write
themselves
when
it
come
to
politics
it
write
themselves
they
do
not
have
my
talent
my
money
or
especially
my
good
look
unfortunately
the
way
we
elect
we
president
be
not
unlike
the
way
we
create
hit
tv
show
with
a
crowded
republican
field
some
voter
be
unimpressed
I
do
not
care
who
be
polling
better
right
now
we
have
many
month
to
go
there
be
go
to
be
a
very
long
process
and
I
will
tell
you
I
be
go
to
do
a
lot
of
research
before
that
happen
but
I
have
not
even
begin
there
be
just
too
many
people
in
the
playing
field
on
the
democratic
side
Hillary
Clinton
come
in
as
the
front-runner
and
stay
there
thank
you
so
much
even
some
in
she
party
rally
around
she
few
challenger
let
make
it
seem
like
we
have
a
lot
of
viable
people
but
the
former
secretary
of
state
still
have
problem
the
only
other
thing
I
can
really
think
of
be
Clinton
Benghazi
amid
persistent
question
about
the
Benghazi
attack
come
the
revelation
that
as
secretary
of
state
she
use
a
private
e-mail
server
in
she
home
to
conduct
government
business
she
try
to
laugh
it
off
hey
do
you
wipe
the
server
what
with
like
a
cloth
or
something
even
as
she
insist
she
do
nothing
wrong
poll
reveal
as
many
as
60
%
of
voter
do
not
trust
she
part
of
be
a
Clinton
it
seem
be
accept
that
there
be
people
out
there
who
will
never
trust
you
and
might
never
like
you
but
still
be
able
to
or
try
to
get
51
%
of
the
vote
strangely
enough
she
best
defense
come
from
she
challenger
Vermont
Bernie
Sanders
the
american
people
be
sick
and
tired
of
hear
about
you
damn
e-mail
Sanders
also
prove
resilient
enough
to
make
some
Democrats
believe
he
have
a
chance
despite
Clinton
big
lead
Barack
Obama
do
not
anybody
know
who
he
be
and
if
he
can
do
it
anybody
can
do
it
I
be
not
surprise
at
all
with
so
many
voter
skeptical
of
the
political
process
and
just
plain
angry
the
biggest
trend
claim
outsider
status
Hillary
like
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
lady
Chris
Christie
be
I
be
a
outsider
because
I
be
a
republican
in
a
democratic
state
one
always
hesitate
to
criticize
or
to
comment
in
a
sense
on
a
political
process
when
the
people
be
be
give
the
right
to
speak
but
this
be
extraordinary
how
many
people
be
run
for
president
there
be
like
eight
I
have
no
idea
the
good
part
be
you
have
people
who
never
care
about
politics
in
they
life
that
actually
be
watch
this
and
they
care
and
they
be
talk
about
it
it
be
trend
as
the
kid
say
it
be
trend
least
effective
way
to
get
yourself
hurt
in
Washington
because
you
might
just
be
shoot
down
fly
a
gyrocopter
to
the
capital
in
a
call
for
campaign
finance
reform
most
effective
way
to
get
hear
black
life
matter
the
group
confront
politician
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
scoring
headline
every
time
some
do
not
like
they
method
but
--
child
please
black
life
matter
by
large
have
be
the
most
peaceful
protest
when
compare
to
some
of
these
other
movement
if
you
catch
my
drift
worst
job
of
convincing
voter
they
be
listen
to
anyone
the
Congress
I
think
Congress
be
Darth
vader
I
do
not
think
there
be
anything
Congress
can
do
to
make
itself
more
likable
whether
it
be
a
democratic
Congress
or
Republican
Congress
it
be
just
one
of
those
word
that
Americans
seem
to
think
you
know
fingernail
on
a
chalkboard
right
now
even
the
speaker
of
the
House
step
down
day
John
Boehner
be
so
happy
about
leave
that
job
like
he
be
literally
singing
as
he
walk
up
to
the
podium
the
economy
always
a
cornerstone
of
voter
interest
keep
slowly
improve
however
--
wages
be
not
go
up
the
way
many
people
want
people
do
not
feel
like
thing
be
go
great
right
now
and
that
be
a
problem
but
compare
to
the
rest
of
the
world
the
american
economy
be
best
describe
as
the
cleanest
dirty
shirt
in
the
laundry
at
the
White
House
president
Obama
work
hard
on
a
nuclear
arm
agreement
with
Iran
and
a
new
trade
deal
in
the
Pacific
the
Supreme
Court
reject
yet
another
challenge
to
he
health
care
reform
nd
diplomatic
relation
with
Cuba
be
renew
it
be
be
a
brilliant
year
for
Barack
Obama
on
the
other
hand
roughly
half
of
all
Americans
disapprove
of
the
job
he
be
do
I
think
Obama
probably
look
at
the
calendar
like
I
want
to
get
out
of
here

and
be
now
rank
number
one
on
the
planet
what
a
great
year
for
woman
so
you
know
you
have
really
nail
it
when
you
get
the

to
say
a
bad

this
team
teach
all
America
child
that
play
like
a

destroy
almost
everyone
on

however
what
a
fearsome
fearsome
brilliant
athlete
she
be
we
have
not
see
the
best
of
that
woman
I
be
convinced
she
be
one
of
the
best
athlete
not
even
female
athlete
just
one
of
the
best
athlete
in
at
least
a
generation

maybe
history
and
even
the
biggest
mono
y
mono
contest
be
between
the
unstoppable

call
Ronda

and
unbeatable
foe
Holly

do
not
worry
about
ro
Ronda

she
be
still
a
inspiration

I
be
happy
know
that
many
young
girl
out
there
will
get
to
see
Ronda
Rousey
beat
the
live
out
of
another
person
again
many
man
sport
the
best
thing
in
football
be
the
New
England
patriots
snatch
the
Super
Bowl
trophy
from
the
seahawks
but
they
also
give
we
the
worst
thing
deflategate
I
mean
the
suggestion
that
the
Patriots
somehow
cheat
on
they
way
to
the
super
bowl
be
something
that
no
new
England
sports
fan
want
to
hear
or
want
to
hear
we
could
not
get
enough
of
it
the
ball
joke
be
all
over
the
place
someone
deflate
the
ball
they
touch
the
ball
Tom
Brady
say
which

he
like
while
the
NFL
sort
out
that
situation
the

be
on
track
for

the
worst
hit
come
in

high
school
game
when
the
referee
be
tackle

worst
rise
trend
the
rapidly
escalate
concern
about

gambling
be
that

and
in

the
Golden
State
warrior
crush
the
cavaliers
to
take
the
NBA
trophy
I
will
say
that
I
think
Steph

the
Golden

be
one
of
the
most
underappreciated

the

create
a
buzz
online
as

the
very
happy
news
earlier
from

of
a
new
royal
baby
where
be
you
worst
story
to
set
off
tirade
on
social
media
about
a
animal
the
killing
of
Cecil
the
lion
by
a
american
hunter
that
be
a
tricky
thing
because
people
it
be
a
big
tourist
attraction
to
kill
big
game
but
when
you
have
these
beautiful
creature
be

--
general
Alfredo
Stroessner
be
the
last
of
he
kind
in
Paraguay
of
german
heritage
he
rule
the
country
until
1989
with
a
quiet
bavarian
charm
but
behind
the
scene
be
another
thing
utilize
a
outfit
of
ss
police
refer
to
as
the
hairy
footed
one
he
or
turf
and
toss
dissident
out
of
helicopter
over
the
jungle
and
the
list
go
on
under
he
one
in
four
paraguayan
be
say
to
have
cooperate
willingly
or
not
as
pay
informer
on
they
fellow
citizen
it
be
quite
a
history
in
this
country
crazy
quiet
tragic
thing
be
change
a
lot
and
now
thing
be
get
straight
sometime
in
mid
19th
century
1850s
my
grandfather
emigrate
to
South
America
first
in
Argentina
but
apparently
come
here

be
really
almost
all
I
know

sure
he
die
by
the
sword
do
he
die
of
old

die
of
syphilis

would
be
great
my

I
think
in
he
20s

the
longest-living
male
bourdain

lonely
in
the
world
I
be
lonely
in
the
world

if
I
could
solve
the
mystery
of
the
elusive
jean
bourdain
it
would
be
make
I
very
happy
by
the
way
it
would
be
terrific
if
you
find
out
he
own
a
huge
ranch
in
the
Chaco
and
they
be
wait
for
he
relative
to
claim
he
property

some
sense
of
this
country

what
a

long
22
year
why
do
you
come

in
the
first
place
I

the
wall
break
down
and
say
wow

I
have
not

be
the

loot
institution

most
maniacal
insane
suicidal

the
better
part
of
paraguayan
be
behind

I

unchanged

seek
to
create
a
utopia
along
ideological
line
a
mennonite
paradise
repop
late
Latin
America
with
British
Italians
everybody
it
start
with
the
Jesuit
colony
the
new
Bordeaux
I
have
a
great
great
great
grandfather
come
over
to

a
seeker
of
some

originally
from
France
from
France
yes
what
city
do
you

my
great
great
great
grandfather
be
from

I
be
curious
about
this
whole
episode
about
the
settlement
of
new
Bordeaux
the
Paraguay
river
still
as
it
be
150
year
ago
the
country
main
artery
a
thoroughfare
for
transport
people
and
goods
so
who
live
out
there
all
the
people
we
see
fish
out
on
the
river
bank
be
they
fishing
for
dinner
most
of
they
be
fish
for
dinner
call
they
poor
people
but
what
be
poor
they
decide
for
themselves
to
live
here
they
could
go
and
start
work
on
a
construction
place
tomorrow
he
have
organize
a
trip
upriver
to
see
new
Bordeaux
what
be
hope
would
be
a
new
France
in
the
Chaco
fish
we
buy
today
14
kilo
right
that
be
half
a
month
salary
and
you

with
bit
of
good
luck

be
of

sparsely
populate
indigenous
group
a
few
settle
Europeans
Mennonites
Germans
and
every
so

site
where
the
colony
once
briefly
exist
be
now
call
--
be
steal
money
from
each
settler
perhaps
there
be
a
communication
breakdown
somewhere
and
he
might
have
tell
the
Paraguayans
I
be
bring
the
finest
farmer
France
have
to
offer
and
he
might
have
tell
these

dream
so
they
get
break
and
they

whole
elusive
wing
of
South
American

project
runway
contestant
of
they
day
in
1855
Lopez

fond
of
thing
like
french
couture
yes
and
that
change
the
way
of
dress
Madam
Lynch
might
have
be
good
for
business
I
try
to
put
this
in
a
light
I
can
be
enthusiastic
about
like
how
clearly
forward-thinking
my
relative
be
he
customer
be
a
hat
maker
the
very
people
that
treat
Madam
Lynch
with
utter
contempt
do
they
live
in
the
old
colonial
home
the
mansion
we
see
still
that
type
of
residence
yes
time
be
change
in
South
America
too
in
those
day
Society
ladies
crave
the
latest
in
french
fashion

be
money
to
be
make
ah

be
bummed
after

episode
with
the
new
Bordeaux
group
come
a
triple
alliance
war
Jean

1858
yes
it
be
a
good
time
to
die

do
not
have
to
join
this
horrible
war
he
miss
the
war
yes
the
old
Lopez
die
the
young
Lopez
get
in
power
we
man
become
president
yes
Francisco
Lopez
absolutely
the
most
maniacal
megalomaniacal
PISSPOT
dictator
you
be
right
sibling
unkind
to
he
-
he
brother
be
kill
he
sister
be
jail
in
tiger
cage
Tiger

Tiger
cage
and
they

some
50
60-year-old
mother

in
front
of

not
a
nice
man
it
be
believe
he
have
a
chance
to
be
marry
with
the
daughter
of
the
Emperor
of
Brazil
he
be
refuse
in
very
unflattering
term
thanks
presumably
to
Lopez
Junior
expansionist
ambition
he
drag
Paraguay
into
a
triple
alliance
war
he
challenge
all
three
neighbor
Brazil
Argentina
and
Uruguay
--
to
war
this
do
not
seem
like
a
good
idea
no
right
in
what
would
become
the
bloodiest
war
in
Latin
America
history
hundred
of
thousand
of
paraguayan
die
when

be
eventually
hunt
down
Madam
Lynch
survive
yes
she
survive
with
she
money
she
be
allow
to
keep
she
possession
yes
in
history
it
be
hard
to
find
a
more
disastrous
or
more
cruel
or
pointless
campaign
it
would
seem
when
all
be
say
and
do
as
much
as
60
%
of
the
population
and
90
%
of
the
man
of
this
country
be
dead
the
survivor
be
just
like
50
or

ah
the
storybook
kingdom
of
Granada
one
of
the
oldest
most
complex
magically
surreal
place
in
Spain
and
one
of
the
most
beautiful
Granada
be
tuck
against
the
Sierra
Nevada
mountain
of
Andalusia
in
southern
Spain
it
be
not
like
Barcelona
it
be
not
like
San
Sebastian
it
be
not
Madrid
any
reasonably
sentient
person
who
look
at
Spain
come
to
Spain
eat
in
Spain
drink
in
Spain
they
be
go
to
fall
in
love
otherwise
there
be
something
deeply
wrong
with
you
Spain
be
the
sort
of
place
that
never
really
make
any
sense
anyway
and
in
the
very
best
possible
way
this
be
the
country
that
give
we
the
spanish
inquisition
also
anarchy
this
be
where
devout
catholicism
mix
with
surrealism
modernist
cuisine
with
traditional
tapas
Christianity
and
Islam
trade
place
share
space
the
effect
and
influence
of
all
those
thing
be
right
here
to
see
you
can
almost
look
back
through
time
and
through
the
mist
of
history
and
see
the
phoenicians
march
up
across
the
Vega
or
be
those
feral
hippie
a
influx
of
hippie
many
of
whom
appear
to
have
set
up
squat
in
the
cave
of
the
mountain
have
make
thing
interesting
when
you
ask
what
do
you
do
and
you
say
we
be
stage
the
moon
landing
wherever
you
be
on
the
ideological
spectrum
however
some
thing
be
constant
it
seem
some
stereotypical
expectation
it
be
true
there
be
free
tapas
everywhere
yes
they
do
actually
take
siesta
which
be
a
civilized
damn
thing
to
do
as
far
as
I
can
see
flamenco
yes
they
do
that
also
but
in
Granada
they
do
it
old
school
and
oh
yeah
bullfighting
they
do
that
here
too
but
I
digress
I
be
here
actually
to
answer
a
question
what
happen
if
you
go
over
to
the
other
side
say
you
grow
up
in
the
state
and
like
a
lot
of
we
wonder
fantasize
about
what
it
would
be
like
live
abroad
in
old
Europe
surround
by
crusader
castles
delicious
food
another
language
another
culture
what
would
that
alternate
life
that
road
not
take
be
like
my
longtime
friend
and
cameraman
from
Maine
Zach
Zamboni
be
find
out
so
where
be
we
go
right
here
one
of
these
table
which
maybe
we
want
to
do
like
this
with
see
how
often
can
you
go
out
with
somebody
can
properly
block
the
table
it
be
a
misery
be
what
it
be
oh
boy
Ay
yes
of
course
snail
in
a
almond
sauce
about
as
traditional
and
as
delicious
as
it
get
that
be
a
plate
full
of
perfect
happiness
great
Tapas
right
that
be
right
Tapas
come
from
here
this
be
still
one
of
the
few
place
in
Spain
where
they
be
free
all
you
have
to
do
be
keep
drinking
you
can
sit
here
all
day
just
order
a
couple
drink
right
no
rush
plan
on
spend
some
time
here
red
wine
order
tripe
to
follow
tender
spicy
delicious
TRIPE
Sun
Plaza
gut
pretty
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
good
hello
hello
not
too
long
ago
before
Zach
basically
defect
to
Spain
he
meet
fuen
the
next
thing
you
know
he
be
live
here
part
of
a
extended
andalusian
family
eat
the
ham
drink
the
wine
live
the
life
of
the
spanish
dandy
in
freak
Granada
no
less
classically
culturally
speak
do
you
want
a
sensitive
nice
care
thoughtful
guy
well
it
depend
on
the
woman
first
but
usually
we
look
for
this
kind
of
person
that
we
know
he
will
protect
we
from
what
feral
hippie
for
example
you
know
--
I
would
like
to
do
the
vow
of
you
wedding
do
you
Zach
Zamboni
swear
to
protect
fuen
sanchez
from
any
attack
by
feral
cave-dwelling
hippie
who
attempt
to
sell
she
jewelry
or
other
thing
of
little
value
I
figure
now
that
Zach
be
marry
into
a
spanish
family
I
can
piggyback
along
for
a
bit
suck
up
a
little
of
the
magic
live
off
of
what
have
be
my
dream
too
if
we
can
get
weird
for
a
second
here
man
oh
boy
some
place
do
they
have
a
energy
man
about
they
what
be
you
say
man
you
know
I
do
not
want
to
get
into
metaphysics
or
--
you
know
some
place
we
go
you
be
go
to
end
up
live
in
a
cave
if
you
keep
talk
like
this
more
wine
to
see
Spain
to
see
it
straight
to
understand
it
at
all
you
should
probably
peek
if
only
through
spread
finger
at
that
most
spanish
of
tradition
bullfighting
Meet
El
Fandi
one
of
Spain
most
dashing

respected

a
little
practice
first
do
not
worry
this
guy
be
too
young
to

you
see
the
red
Cape
you
know
this
be
the
most
important
thing
where
they

all
the
art
all
the
poetry
exactly

no
deny

terrible
beauty
of

very
complex
tradition

be
not
about
win

general
direction
I
do
not
frankly
it
creeps
I
out

be
tabernacle

best
as
I

Easter
Jesus
and
Mary
theme
drinking
establishment
where
between
drink
one
can
ponder
the
agony
of
the
Christ
but
with
sausage

like

or
just
over
EASTER
the
whole

both
both
of
they
throughout
the
course
of
the
week
over
40-odd
procession
will
creep
slowly
through
these
street
there
be
different
brotherhood
each
with
they
own
sacred
color
crest
insignia
and
so
on
it
be
they
medallion
of
particular
Christ
image
that
adorn
the

nighttime
in
Granada
it
be
time
to
pursue
that
greatest
of
spanish
tradition
TAPAS
you
may
think
you
know
what
a
tapas
be
like
if
you
have
have
small
bite
at
some
fusion
hipster
bar
where
they
do
a
lot
of
little
plate
yeah
that
be
not
a
tapa
how
often
do
you
do
this
a
week
I
do
it
five
day
a
week
it
be
rare
not
to
do
this
but
you
know
it
be
like
on
a
weekend
you
come
out
for
a
bunch
weekday
you
come
out
for
one
this
be
latana
a
little
place
run
by
sommelier
Jesus
and
Louisa
brother
and
sister
one
bartender
one
cook
take
care
of
everything
Tapas
be
free
that
be
the
main
issue
of
the
TAPAS
so
you
be
just
pay
for
the
wine
exactly
so
if
I
be
like
a
degenerate
wino
I
could
still
eat
well
as
long
as
I
can
afford
my
wine
I
would
eat
that
be
right
cheer
let
we
put
this
theory
into
practice
with
we
first
round
of
drink
come
this
it
be
tomato
with
bread
garlic
olive
oil
and
blended
I
could
pretty
much
eat
that
all
day
that
be
right
Tapas
be
free
it
should
not
work
but
somehow
it
do
another
drink
another
tapa
tomato
olive
oil
bread
yeah
awesome
it
be
amazing
so
all
I
have
get
to
do
be
keep
drinking
and
and
I
be
go
to
eat
like
a
king
they
will
keep
feed
you
although
maybe
you
would
be
interested
in
caviar
really
yeah
that
be
not
include
with
my
--
that
be
not
the
point
of
the
TAPAS
usually
you
have
a
few
tapa
you
start
to
get
hungry
they
be
just
hook
you
in
with
this
it
be
all
a
scam
it
be
a
scam
a
couple
little
nibble
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
be
order
200
gram
of
caviar
caviar
be
not
free
my
friend
Delicious
entirely
sustainable
spanish
caviar
from
farm
river
sturgeon
some
high
test
caviar
oh
you
guy
be
go
to
eat
the
whole
thing
in
one
sorry
be
there
something
wrong
with
that
not
even
married
yet
it
be
nag
nag
nag
next
place
let
do
it
ah
TAPAS
what
a
novel
concept
there
be
even
a
verb
for
it
Tapayar
mean
to
take
TAPAS
as
in
if
we
go
to
tapayar
some
more
we
be
go
to
have
to
elbow
past
this
crowd
of
Catholics
here
be
it
extra
insane
because
it
be
Santo
Semana
yes
but
it
be
always
busy
here
man
oh
boy
the
bar
we
be
go
be
just
on
the
other
side
maybe
we
go
around
with
parade
crisscross
the
city
in
every
direction
the
steady
drumbeat
wash
you
that
you
route
be
about
to
be
cut
off
entirely
for
the
next
40
minute
we
can
cross
we
can
cross
we
have
to
go
around
where
go
around
go
around
go
around
we
need
to
walk
past
pardon
pardon
people
take
they
procession
very
seriously
here
and
be
not
exactly
accommodate
to
anyone
who
threaten
to
block
the
view
that
be
amazing
right
see
tell
I
there
be
not
some
Duende
in
that
music
yeah
there
be
Duende
in
that
music
finally
bar
number
two
Oliver
this
place
be
always
pack
beer
please
and
with
it
come
a
delightful
tapa
of
mussel
steam
in
butter
and
olive
oil
that
be
a
great
tapa
come
on
this
be
what
be
different
people
come
in
here
and
they
will
eat
like
this
perfectly
happy
perfectly
content
to
forego
the
table
come
here
stand
around
and
eat
like
this
exactly
FUEN
glass
of
wine
come
with
fried
eggplant
and
honey
which
sound
to
I
like
it
be
moorish
in
origin
more
wine
follow
by
these
delicious
little
clam
oh
yeah
and
the
main
event
now
we
be
talk
yes
these
langostine
be
not
tapas
and
consequently
not
free
but
worth
it
at
any
price
that
be
so
totally
awesome
we
do
good
work
here
anything
else
should
we
go
on
no
let
move
on
as
this
death
march
of
Tapas
continue
thing
start
to
get
a
little
weird
this
be
the
story
of
my
life
he
do
not
do
this
at
home
do
he
no
thank
God
now
I
understand
what
you
feel
yes
every
day
finally
a
little
empathy
I
do
like
the
increasingly
meta-aspect
of
this
show
I
should
really
be
live
streaming
now
we
can
really
be
interesting
finally
bar
Gallardo
just
make
it
before
close
let
be
honest
we
have
have
a
lot
to
eat
and
drink
at
this
point
some
restraint
need
to
be
show
little
Fried
fish
Dude
little
fried
fish
little
one
then
we
be
do
and
cheese
but
instead
three
more
beer
three
more
tapas
cheese
little
Fried
smelt
and
baby
lamb
chop
these
be
super
good
these
be
super
good
I
be
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
of
something
for
nothing
it
be
not
something
for
nothing
three
dollar
for
a
glass
of
wine
be
something
for
nothing
if
somebody
can
get
the
math
right
in
the
this
will
take
off
no
never
really
we
will
never
have
tapas
culture
in
America
really
never
ever
ever
you
be
look
to
change
the
entire
day
from
the
minute
you
get
up
in
the
morning
in
America
you
nap
in
the
afternoon
be
you
out
of
you
mind
I
want
to
walk
to
my
bar
I
want
to
have
a
little
beer
I
want
a
golden
unicorn
that
--
money
both
of
those
scenario
be
equally
likely
nobody
move
get
on
the
floor
do
something
oh
I
be
not
a
security
guard
I
be
a
security
monitor
I
only
notify
people
if
there
be
a
robbery
there
be
a
robbery
why
monitor
a
problem
if
you
do
not
fix
it
that
be
why
lifelock
do
more
than
free
credit
monitoring
to
protect
you
from
identity
theft
we
not
only
alert
you
to
identity
threat
if
you
have
a
problem
we
will
spend
up
to
a
million
dollar
on
lawyer
and
expert
to
fix
it
lifelock
join
start
at
$
a
month
hi
mom
hi
every
mom
be
a
coach
a
artist
sometimes
even
a
zoologist
every
mom
be
a
work
mom
and
it
be
work
mom
everywhere
who
inspire
we
to
work
harder
so
we
make
we
banquet
meal
even
better
with
mash
potato
now
make
with
real
cream
and
chicken
strip
with
100
%
natural
chicken
breast
so
now
there
be
more
to
love
with
banquet
now
serve
a
better
banquet
every
storybook
kingdom
need
a
castle
Granada
it
be
get
a
good
one
the
Alhambra
one
of
the
most
enchanted
inscrutable
maddeningly
beautiful
structure
ever
create
by
man
build
on
top
of
9th
century
fortification
by
the
Nasrid
Dynasty
and
add
to
and
add
to
as
history
unfold
through
war
and
tragedy
and
invasion
and
conquest
on
the
outside
it
be
very
bare
all
you
see
be
the
tiny
window
and
its
project
impenetrability
but
then
you
come
in
here
Zach
have
go
well
let
call
it
what
it
be
a
bit
mad
about
the
place
the
detail
can
obsess
a
man
Zach
be
a
cinematographer
so
you
can
understand
how
that
might
get
a
grip
on
a
guy
whose
profession
be
the
intricate
play
between
light
and
darkness
my
theory
be
they
be
try
to
weave
nature
calligraphy
symbol
these
be
all
inscription
within
here
inscription
turn
into
graphic
because
the
magna
carta
do
not
depict
word
from
God
yes
but
what
you
can
depict
and
this
be
what
this
entire
place
be
be
geometric
system
yes
when
the
NASRID
dynasty
live
here
it
be
a
harmonious
space
where
light
shade
water
the
transit
of
the
moon
and
star
be
harness
and
glorified
I
think
the
best
assumption
be
nothing
be
random
they
come
here
and
lay
out
everything
accord
to
--
a
plan
this
be
a
place
for
reflection
each
element
of
design
presumably
intend
to
have
effect
both
psychological
and
religious
it
be
really
a
cinematographer
paradise
because
everything
be
about
light
and
math
obviously
they
be
not
cinematographer
but
everything
be
frame
for
they
how
long
do
it
take
they
to
build
this
hundred
of
year
that
be
why
it
take
so
long
for
you
to
get
the
shot
oh
snap
in
the
builder
time
engineer
astronomer
mathematician
be
like
priest
magician
possessor
of
divine
knowledge
of
how
the
universe
work
do
they
want
to
contemplate
nature
or
do
they
want
to
conquer
it
control
it
they
be
certainly
try
to
emulate
it
all
they
mathematics
be
try
to
find
out
how
nature
work
particularly
the
square
root
and
the
repetition
of
pattern
they
see
mathematical
pattern
in
the
sky

the
way
water
move

ripple
the
way
thing
grow
the
simple
pine
cone
a
Fern
a
pomegranate
and
they
think
about
the
basic
truth
these
thing
might
represent
these
symmetry
can
all
be
shuffle
spin
on
any
point
and
they
align
again
with
themselves
so
if
you
stretch
they
out
for
they
they
point
to
infinity
we
will
understand
all
thing
through
contemplate
sacred
geometry
how
do
nature
unfold
pattern
itself
could
the
basic
design
of
nature
even
if
divine
be
replicate
in
this
magnificent
structure

to
solve
the
riddle

what
this
nice
family
do
not
realize
be
they
be
not

gain
a

also
a
annoying
half
drunk
and
extremely
hungry
uncle
Tony
and
I
know
what
happen
here
yes
so
let
--
okay
sit
there
ready
to
be
carve
you

that
Zach
have
to
prove
to
we
that
he
be
able
to
cut
the
ham
before
he
propose
to
my
sister
I
think
that
be
a
completely
reasonable
policy
eventually
the
appropriate
hour
for
lunch
approach
so
not
to
embarrass
you
publicly
but
the
Maine
be
not
exactly
the
Mediterranean
of
America
let
put
it
that
way
how
be
he
adapt
to
the
spanish
lifestyle
let
face
it
he
be
--
he
be
more
spanish
than
I
really
yeah
in
the
first
week
he
be
like
I
do
not
understand
how
you
can
take
Siesta
week
after
I
need
a
siesta
it
be
interesting
to
see
how
you
have
make
the
transition
cheer
cheer
first
up
this
Bacaloa
salad
salt
cod
egg
black
olive
orange
tomato
dress
in
olive
oil
remember
this
be
holy
week
Maria
Jose
be
prepare
recipe
that
go
back
through
the
family
so
far
that
nobody
know
exactly
where
they
even
come
from
miga
another
iconic
dish
of
Andalusia
informally
refer
to
as
the
shepherd
lunch
as
the
story
go
bear
as
a
way
to
use
old
hard
bread
and
combine
all
the
week
leftovers
I
be
tell
every
household
in
Spain
have
a
variation
what
change
be
what
you
put
on
it
today
it
be
sardine
cod
Chorizo
melon
and
pepper
oh

--
Big

resist
siesta

you
can
not
do
it
here
society
will
not
accept
you
not
take
a
siesta
but
that
be
the
flow
of
life
here
that
sort
of
beg
the
question
then
while

you

bad
representative
one
guy

conservative
they
would
agree
they
all

to
rise
up
and
do
it
he
be
the
only
person
we
be
hear
they
can
not
get
on

she

to
Chris
Cuomo
for
30
minute
on
the
phone
call
in
from
the
car
30
minute
he
will
say
that
Ben
Carson
want
to
get
on
the
air
and
say
something
if
you
be
go
to
let
this
continue
to
spew
hatred
and
he
whole
horrible
agenda
that
be
on
they
if
you
find
he
to
be
the
evil
empire
take
he
down
until
you
do
do
not
complain
that
he
be
on
the
air
he
be
willing
to
say
that
if
they
denounce
he
switch
gear
Harrison
Ford
be
chat
up
a
storm
he
be
great
in
interview
he
be
have
a
great
time
Han
Solo
baby
he
will
say
whatever
I
like
it
it
be
refreshing
he
look
into
the
camera
and
it
be
a
movie
Donald
he
be
just
roll
I
do
not
know
I
like
it
who
just
rip
Taylor
swift
and
she
girl
squad
maybe
the
Donald
do
more
plug
in
come
up
to
a
scathing
critique
of
Taylor
Swift
refer
to
she
as
a
nazi
Barbie
a
model
girl
squad
be
nothing
more
than
a
performance
prop
they
go
on
to
say
the
girl
squad
mentality
promote
elitism
back
from
the
plug
in
what
do
they
think
about
that
my
kid
listen
to
fight
song
every
day
in
the
car
this
be
my
fight
song
take
back
my
life
song
it
have
a
great
message
and
the
only
way
that
she
get
on
the
scene
be
because
Taylor
swift
tour
with
she
woman
should
be
uplifting
woman
this
woman
be
68
year
old
she
should
not
be
critique
Taylor
swift
she
use
word
like
nazi
and
fascist
blond
even
if
you
do
not
like
she
music
I
be
a
grown
man
and
what
she
do
for
she
fan
she
be
not
out
there
expose
herself
like
contemporary
she
have
not
kardashian
herself
and
be
not
famous
for
not
have
talent
for
another
woman
to
drag
she
down
and
say
she
should
try
to
be
more
bonding
like
man
a
true
feminist
would
support
that
this
young
woman
take
apple
down
about
she
music
that
be
woman
empowerment
and
what
this
woman
should
be
about
not
like
a
Harry
Potter
villain
I
find
it
disturbing
and
I
read
the
article
and
think
it
be
wrong
the
nazi
Barbie
she
have
go
back
to
a
dark
place
write
about
Taylor
swift
be
a
ordeal
it
be
go
back
to
the
fascist
blond
I
think
she
want
to
be
in
the
bad
blood
video
you
see
all
the
cool
pretty
girl
together
we
know
Taylor
swift

the
kind
thing
she
have
do
for
people

a
not
so
beautiful
and
not
so
shapely
person
would
walk
by
would
they
be
nice

she
project

of
cheese
and
egg
plant
parm
or
chicken
parm
on
a
sub
real
italian
cuisine
be
actually
very
simple
and
very
healthy
Mediterranean
food
be
olive
oil
dark
leafy
green
lot
of
seafood
lean
protein
brace
meat
and
vegetable
Oz
italian
culture
be
very
specifically
healthy
because
it
be
so
rich
in
its
sauce
if
you
do
not
mind
you
be
so
good
at
this
I
would
love
you
to
walk
we
through
some
of
you
sauce
you
be
go
to
use
some
superfood
in
these
every
italian
sauce
be
different
people
take
pride
in
it
they
guard
they
secret
I
think
probably
the
most
basic
sauce
for
everybody
be
just
marinara
it
drive
I
nut
when
you
go
to
a
grocery
store
and
you
see
people
buy
these
really
expensive
bottle
of
you
know
whoever
be
marinara
sauce
marinara
sauce
be
as
cheap
as
a
can
of
tomato
a
little
bit
of
garlic
olive
oil
you
can
throw
in
fresh
herb
or
dry
I
like
freshtime
I
like
a
little
bit
of
fennel
seed
my
mother
Sicilian
so
I
always
put
a
little
heat
in
a
little
chilly
flake
--
Chile
flake
and
a
little
bit
of
salt
and
tomato
and
that
be
it
you
let
this
cook
down
this
cost
as
much
as
a
can
of
tomato
you
probably
have
the
rest
of
this
stuff
in
you
pantry
some
of
those
jarred
sauce
if
they
be
gourmet
honestly
they
cost
$
10
for
this
little
tiny
quart
of
sauce
it
be
insane
to
I
it
take
five
minute
to
make
this
you
melt
the
garlic
in
the
oil
and
when
you
cook
you
own
sauce
you
control
the
salt
the
fat
and
the
quality
of
ingredient
jarred
sauce
if
you
really
read
they
they
have
lot
of
times
add
sugar
in
they
and
ton
and
ton
of
salt
you
do
not
need
much
you
should
be
able
to
taste
the
flavor
of
the
herb
and
the
spice
Oz
I
be
go
to
show
you
the
amount
of
average
salt
we
find
Rachel
sauce
that
you
just
make
for
we
right
here
18
milligram
see
the
difference
Oz
what
surprise
I
the
most
be
you
sauce
taste
so
darn
good
and
they
can
have
so
little
salt
and
sugar
it
highlight
the
fact
that
it
be
just
junk
we
add
we
do
not
need
exactly
tomato
be
naturally
sweet
Oz
you
have
a
trick
for
get
the
pass
to
--
pasta
to
stick
to
the
spaghetti
starchy
water
salt
the
water
of
the
pasta
it
be
the
only
chance
you
get
to
flavor
the
pass
at
it
always
drain
the
pasta
before
it
be
toot
juice
or
bite
but
the
thing
narry
pasta
to
sauce
be
a
little
bit
of
that
starchy
water
when
you
drain
the
pasta
Oz
you
add
it
afterwards
toss
all
of
the
pasta
with
all
of
the
sauce
and
it
be
the
starchy
cooking
water
that
make
the
sauce
marry
the
pasta
Oz
we
always
salt
the
water
before
we
add
the
pasta
no
you
add
the
starchy
water
while
you
be
toss
the
pasta
and
you
keep
add
it
until
all
of
the
sauce
coat
all
of
the
pasta
nothing
drive
I
crazier
than
a
plate
of
naked
spaghetti
with
a
little
blob
of
sauce
in
the
middle
it
make
no
sense
do
not
you
want
it
all
to
taste
good
it
do
not
make
any
sense
to
I
then
my
mommy
always
put
in
a
little
bit
of
cheese
while
you
be
toss
and
my
grandfather
always
finish
everything
with
a
little
drizzle
of
good
olive
oil
it
be
a
big
thing
now
that
people
be
watch
they
gluten
they
carb
all
of
that
this
sauce
you
can
put
on
shredded
spaghetti
squash
delicious
could
you
put
it
on
some
boil
potato
if
you
be
gluten-free
there
be
lot
of
different
delicious
way
to
use
marinara
of
course
everybody
love
those
parm
sand
witch
why
do
not
you
just
--
sandwich
why
do
not
you
just
grill
or
roast
you
egg
plant
you
save
all
those
calorie
and
all
that
fat
of
the
breading
and
all
of
that
Oz
do
you
bother
make
the
pasta
sauce
ahead
of
time
or
it
be
so
easy
it
be
not
worth
it
and
when
we
have

boil
up
the
tomato
for
30
seconds
and
put
they
through
a
food
meal
I
have
about
900
bag
of
tomato
sauce
in
my
freezer

when
you
be
go
to
make
a
base
sauce
like
marinara
that

a
double
batch
cool

put
it
in
a
plastic
food
storage
bag
and
I
store
all
of

we
superfood
kale
when
you
be
go
to
deal
with
kale
you
stem
it
like
this
you
curl
you
finger
up

kitty
cat
you
pile

if
you
use
whole
wheat
or
whole
grain
spaghetti
you
be
add
ton
of
protein

ton
of
fiber

pair
up

I

coat
you

you
want
to
look
for
something
that
be
go
to
coat
that
irritation
in
you
throat
and
provide
a
little
relief
and
for
that
I
would
recommend
lozenge
there
be
two
type
the
first
type
be
a
suck
candy
or
something
like
that
that
be
go
to
add
saliva
to
you
throat
to
moisturize
the
area
in
the
hospital
when
that
pain
get
really
bad
you
want
to
use
medicate
like
these
they
have
lidocaine
and
menthol
that
be
really
go
to
hope
to
soothe
that
medication
Oz
the
medication
they
use
for
pain
be
very
clear
all
of
that
air
irritate
the
throat
and
you
kill
the
pain
down
you
do
it
with
the
menthol
the
medicated
coughlin
drop
--
cough
drop
that
be
easy
to
take
that
be
the
first
tip
the
second
tip
in
hospital
for
a
sore
throat
nurse
Mike
rein
and
relieve
I
recommend
garage
with
cold
salt
water
Oz
Cold
why
cold
nurse
Mike
a
lot
of
people
think
that
warm
be
the
way
to
go
the
hot
water
can
add
more
pain
to
you
throat
you
go
with
the
cold
salt
water
and
like
everything
else
that
cold
be
go
to
provide
a
little
more
relief
to
the
irritated
area
Oz
that
be
what
I
love
about

most
important
thing
you

something
to
provide
relief

both
provide
pain
relief

the
tissue
swell

this
be
definitely
a
suicide
letter
a
routine
cell
search
reveal
a
inmate
on
the
edge
and
prison
official
intervene
why
you
go
to
go
and
strip
I
out
again
because
that
be
the
protocol
that
be
bull
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
and
you
know
it
we
turn
some
of
the
camera
over
to
we
inmate
for
a
personal
glimpse
of
they
life
in
prison
get
the
back
piece
on
camera
baby
Huh
show
off
you
work
son
I
be
grow
old
in
here
white
hair
gray
hair
go
bald
life
over
with
be
this
place
stressful
hell
yeah
it
be
stressful
this
be
one
of
the
stressfullest
thing
you
can
do
you
try
to
think
of
anything
you
can
do
that
relieve
a
little
bit
of
stress
you
know
from
draw
a
picture
to
lift
weight
to
--
I
mean
anything
it
be
horrible
nobody
want
to
do
this
407
isolate
among
the
rural
farming
community
of
southwestern
Indiana
the
Wabash
valley
correctional
facility
be
340
acre
of
concrete
razor
wire
and
broken
dream
for
the
more
than
in
mate
incarcerate
at
this
maximum
security
prison
they
arrive
from
all
over
the
state
but
superintendent
Dick
Brown
who
run
wabash
and
begin
he
career
as
a
correction
officer
here
19
year
earlier
have
see
a
big
change
in
the
population
get
the
door
please
traditionally
most
of
the
prisoner
be
from
inner
city
Gary
Indianapolis
South
Bend
Fort
Wayne
now
we
be
see
a
lot
more
offender
come
in
from
rural
community
I
think
that
be
due
in
part
to
the
methamphetamine
problem
the
ingredient
for
methamphetamine
come
from
farm
so
that
be
why
we
have
a
large
amount
of
offender
that
be
be
incarcerate
I
mean
in
my
opinion
from
local
small
community
they
get
involve
with
the
meth
ring
and
get
catch
up
and
then
they
end
up
in
the
Indiana
Department
of
correction
I
have
get
to
be
honest
the
police
in
my
town
most
of
they
know
I
on
a
first
name
basis
it
be
the
same
thing
over
and
over
day
in
day
out
methamphetamine
use
be
the
worst
thing
I
ever
come
in
contact
with
my
only
regret
I
wish
I
never
ever
in
my
life
see
it
for
the
hundred
good
story
I
could
tell
you
Ky
turn
around
and
tell
you
three
time
the
bad
story
it
make
I
feel
the
greatest
at
time
and
make
I
hate
myself
most
of
the
time
Chazz
Harper
be
currently
serve
he
fourth
prison
term
the
first
three
total
about
six
year
for
theft
and
burglary
but
when
he
be
then
catch
with
114
gram
of

the
judge
throw
the
book
at
he
I
be
sentence
to
72
year
which
mean
I
have
to
do
36
that
be
12
year
more
than
a
murder
most
murderer
get
60
year
it
be
hard
for
my
family
to
grasp
that
amount
of
time
for
the
charge
I
mean
how
do
you
explain
to
a
6-year-old
why
you
dad
can
not
come
home
and
how
do
you
explain
to
a
11-year-old

be
a
grown
man
before

ever
see
I

this
-lsb-
bleep
-rsb-
you
be
go

be
a
domestic
battery
case
I

to
God
I

it
out
Carr

I
start

for
he
legal
fee

for
he

no

remember
nearly
every
blood
spot

a
dry

can
be
a
side
effect
of
many

but
it
can
also
lead
to
tooth
decay
and
bad
breath
that
be
why
there
be
biotene
available

a
oral
rinse
toothpaste
spray
or

Biotene
can
provide
soothing
relief
and
it
help
keep

more
over

and
as
the
wind
shift
a
little
bit
that
should
push
that
snow
back
out
over
the
lake
and
it
be
go
to
include
drier
air
move
in

that

it
be
a
tactic
he
be
use
before
instruct
White
House
attorney
to
scour
the

look
for
way
to
allow
the

but
substantial
change
to

happen
with
immigration
and
the
EPA
gun
be
the
next

and
later
the

go

alone
this
have
be
he
movement
it
be
become
a
huge
issue
and
it
will
remain
a
major
issue
go
forward
especially
on
the
2016
campaign
trail
where
candidate
like
former
Florida
governor
Jeb
Bush
who
be
expect
to
attend
a
gun
show
in
the
sunshine
state
tomorrow
could
use
the
issue
to
draw
a
distinction
between
what
some
see
as
a
overreach
by
the
president
and
a
right
guarantee
by
the
second
amendment
this
as
the
National
Rifle
Association
Institute
for
legislative
action
launch
a
ad
attack
gun
control
advocate
include
democratic
front-runner
Hillary
Clinton
and
of
course
we
have
be
report
here
at
Fox
for
sometime
we
expect
the
White
House
to
unveil
its
executive
action
on
gun
in
early
January
and
now
give
the
fact
that
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
will
meet
early
next

it
be
very
likely
now
that
the
public
will
get
its
first
view
of
the
plan
next
week
as
well
thank
you
safe
trip
home
one
of
pro-am
first
act
as
president
be
to
sign
a
executive
order
promise
he
would
close
the
prison
at
Guantanamo
Bay
in
a
year
seven
year
later

remain
open
he
blame
Congress
a
new
report
suggest
the

be
not
just
get
pushback
from
lawmaker

detail
there
be
107

of
they
be
hard-core
terrorist
president
Obama

my
expectation
be
by
early

that
population
below
100
and
we
will
continue
continue
to
steadily
chip
away
at
the
MBLT
number
in
Guantanamo

DONALD

join
the
new

eve
festivity
here
on
Fox
talk
about
he
chance
in
a
general
election
against
Hillary

I
think
I
will
be
she
worst
nightmare
but
we
be
go
to
find
out
look
she
will
not
do
the
job
we
be
go
to
do
the
job
and
we
be
go
to
do
some
really
special
thing
so
I
look
forward
to
it
if
it
be
Hillary
Clinton
that
be
in
the
race
I
look
forward
to
go
against
she
thanks
to
he
rise
poll
number
the
question
we
use
to
hear
most
frequently
about
trump
can
he
win
the
nomination
have
give
way
to
a
new
one
be
he
electable
in
a
general
election
chief
Washington
correspondent
James
Rosen
report
that
the
answer
may
need
to
account
for
force
beyond
the
one
we
usually
consider
we
be
go
to
make
America
great
again
and
I
love
you
all
as
Donald
Trump
rally
what
he
call
America
silent
majority
many
analyst
argue
that
which
have
work
so
well
for
the
real
estate
mogul
and
reality
tv
star
up
to
now
the
unique
bleth
of
populism
nativism
stand-up
comedy
and
tough-talking
bragging
will
keep
the
Gop
front-run
frer
win
the
oval
office
I
think
that
Donald
Trump
downfall
come
in
the
general
election
at
least
now
when
we
look
at
the
snapshot
of
polling
he
lose
to
Hillary
Clinton
as
oppose
to
other
GOP
candidate
in
the
field
as
a
result
of
he
attitude
of
no
political
correctness
insult
of
everyone
that
you
can
name
I
I
the
general
public
do
not
necessarily
buy
that
kind
of
donald
trump
behavior
like
maybe
he
gop
primary
voter
do
we
instinct
in
assess
electoral
prospects
be
to
grasp
for
number
metric
polling
datum
the
most
glaring
lesson
of
the
year
be
the
fact
that
Donald
Trump
be
a
singular
figure
one
who
defy
odds
metric
and
the
usual
rule
and
prediction
that
be
base
on
such
datum
nobody
have
do
what
I
have
do
probably
nobody
that
be
ever
run
for
office
have
do
what
I
have
do
while
trump
be
a
novice
at
the
business
of
campaign
and
election
Americans
and
New
Yorkers
in
particular
have
know
this
man
for
decade
as
a
master
manipulator
of
mass
media
and
messaging
he
be
be
count
out
countless
time
tell
by
the
keeper
of
the
met
ricks
at
various
point
that
he
would
never
match
he
father
real
estate
career
never
recover
from
he
divorce
and
bankruptcy
never
appeal
to
a
mass
audience
on
network
television
and
repeatedly
to
this
day
this
singular
figure
bold
cunning
and
to
many
repellent
have
always
find
a
way
to
win
Donald
Trump
seem
to
have
a
separate
set
of
rule
he
sort
of
impose
they
on
the
process
a
lot
of
people
find
that
not
a
pretty
picture
Trump
would
object
to
that
he
would
say
I
be
pretty
Carl
I
be
the
prettiest
person
in
this
interview
you
be
a
loser
and
he
fan
be
cheer
in
all
this
trump
resemble
another
legendary
loudmouth
Cassius
Clay
later
muhamm
Ali
the
boxer
press
say
the
Louisville
lip
could
never
win
because
he
hold
he
hand
too
low
evade
punch
by
snap
he
head
back
violation
of
the
sweet
science
no
one
could
get
away
with
Ali
have
skill
that
be
extraordinary
I
think
they
be
just
god-given
I
do
not
think
it
be
Angie
Dundee
who
bring
those
skill
out
and
I
think
Donald
Trump
do
not
have
any
handler
he
do
not
have
pollster
he
do
not
have
adviser
the
fact
that
he
be
do
all
this
on
he
own
be
a
sign
of
he
great
skill
and
great
ability
to
communicate
author
do
show
a
rm
forepollster
and
aide
to
president
Clinton
think
the
metric
of
2016
for
those
who
value
number
more
than
the
intangible
factor
create
by
singular
figure
necessarily
favor
the
likely
democratic
nominee
could
he
win
yes
do
the
metric
suggest
it
yes
and
be
it
extraordinary
that
he
be
get
as
far
as
he
have
absolutely
I
do
not
count
he
out
in
the
election
one
key
difference
between
boxing
and
presidential
politics
be
that
the
former
be
a
solitary
pursuit
the
latter
one
that
involve
not
just
a
fight
candidate
but
a
vast
organization
of
people
in
all
50
state
whether
Donald
Trump
can
assemble
such
a
organization
remain
unseen
but
in
do
so
he
singular
personality
will
again
prove
key
to
he
success
in
Washington

the

line
be
all

real
when
you

you
doctor
will
often
prescribe
a

but
what
if
the
medicine
do
not
work
what
if
there
be
not
any
medicine
strong
enough
to
treat
it
what
happen
during
the
worldwide
flu
pandemic
in
1918
when
more
than
50
million
people
die
of

medicine
have
come
a
long
way
since
then
but
lead
researcher
be
warn
there
be
a
new
superbug
that
be
quickly
spread
across
the

and
they
say
it
be
almost
too
late
to
stop
it
what
be
happen
be
the
problem
seem
to
be
get
worse
resistance
have
be
identify
against
probably
all
antibiotic
in

today
what
make
this
superbug
know
as
the
mcr

gene
so
concern
be
not
only
be
it
nearly
invincible
to
we
current
antibiotic
but
the
superbug
pass
that
immunity
along
when
it
be
transfer
to

such
as

and
know
MOANIA
leave
infected
patient
with

matter
of
time
before
it

worldwide
the
food

drug
administration
explain
that
the
growth
of
SUPERBUGS
be
largely
due
to
the

which
over

allow

up
immunity
to

drug
in

essential
that

rich
Social
media
have
become
a
huge
part
of
daily
life
for
million
of
Americans
for
all
the
2016
candidate
a
way
to
connect
and
interact
with
real
people
for
real
cheap
but
how
much
will
those
connection
and
like
usually
translate
into
vote
correspondent
Peter
doocy
report
now
what
you
might
call
viral
voter
the
path
to
the
White
House
go
through
you
pocket
because
social
media
feed
on
you
phone
or
on
you
computer
be
where
presidential
hopeful
be
try
to
pick
up
traction
like
instagram
with
15-second
ad
that
cost
almost
nothing
to
distribute
but
can
direct
the
dialogue
for
day
Donald
Trump
command
the
most
attention
on
twitter
too
mostly
with
post
critical
of
rival
sometimes
with
content
consider
controversial
but
everyone
try
to
make
a
splash
there
like
when
Hillary
Clinton
and
Jeb
Bush
confront
each
other
this
summer
and
just
about
everybody
running
have
use
some
form
of
social
media
to
chat
with
potential
supporter
sometimes
it
be
tough
to
tell
who
be
actually
do
the
typing
at
the
other
end
but
sometimes
it
be
pretty
obvious
the
third
question
most
popular
question
from
Google
be
be
rand
Paul
still
run
for
president
and
I
do
not
know
I
would
not
be
do
this
dumb-ass
live-streaming
if
I
be
not
here
be
the
important
thing
about
clip
like
that
expert
say
the
real
impact
on
social
media
do
not
happen
when
a
a
user
see
it
be
for
themselves
but
instead
when
a
user
read
how
people
they
know
in
real
life
be
react
to
it
I
think
what
you
friend
say
you
friend
recommendation
tend
to
carry
more
weight
than
a
politician
for
better
or
worse
the
quick
and
cheap
medium
backfire
easily
Carly
Fiorina
learn
that
today
when
a
tweet
about
root
for
Iowa
over
she
alma
mater
in
the
Rose
Bowl
be
pan
by
some
as
pandering
still
expert
see
a
lot
more
benefit
from
social
media
it
let
candidate
spread
out
instead
of
spending
so
much
time
in
early
state
it
be
helpful
certainly
but
it
be
not
the
only
way
to
reach
people
ultimately
only
one
thing
matter
Trump
have
garner
incredible
media
attention
simply
by
tweet
the
question
that
everybody
need
to
ask
themselves
be
be
those
tweet
go
to
translate
into
actual
vote
so
long-time
political
consultant
be
puzzle
nobody
know
if
the
candidate
with
the
most
viral
post
on
facebook
or
twitter
will
get
the
most
vote
but
folk
do
not
have
to
wait
long
to
find
out
because
the
Iowa
Caucus
be
one
month

small
New

apartment
protect
you
belongings
let
GEICO
help
you
with
renter
insurance
my
new
year
resolution
be
to
move
forward
on
we
unfinished
business
as
much
as
I
can
and
I
will
be
more
frequently
ask
for
you
help
that
be
what
this
american
project
be
all
about
that
be
especially
true
for
one
piece
of
unfinished
business
we
epidemic
of
gun
violence
let
bring
in
we
panel
Jason
Riley
columnist
with
the
Wall
Street
Journal
Karen
Tumtty
and
syndicate
columnist
Charles
Krauthammer
this
be
sort
of
a
old
habit
for
the
president
executive
action
jam
it
down
Congress
throat
he
be
not
go
back
essentially
the
president
want
to
disarm
law-abiding
resident
in
the
name
of
make
the
country
safer
it
be
a
a
surd
strategy
he
use
these
tragedy
to
push
gun
regulation
that
would
not
have
prevent
the
tragedy
in
the
first
place
the
recent
shooting
like
San
Bernardino
the
gun
be
purchase
legally
he
continue
down
this
road
plus
ED
San
Bernardino
be
a
terror
attack
inspire
by
Isis
the
response
to
San
Bernardino
be
to
defeat
Isis
not
push
for
more
gun
control
I
want
to
get
to
Karen
Jason
as
a
conservative
why
not
go
with
the
low-hanging
fruit
and
do
some
of
the
gun
control
measure
that
be
smaller
that
be
not
sweeping
and
that
have
wipe
support
in
the
country
there
be
some
evidence
that
gun
control
control
the
supply
of
gun
out
there
I
would
be
with
you
but
we
have
no
such
evidence
I
think
he
be
do
this
because
it
play
well
with
he
base
it
be
a
good
fundraising
opportunity
for
the
democratic
party
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
effectiveness
in
reduce
gun
violence
for
the
president
conservative
get
upset
whether
it
be
immigration
or
gun
but
this
strategy
have
work
for
this
president
it
have
and
the
one
measure
that
we
have
hear
about
which
be
expand
background
check
be
something
that
90
%
of
the
public
support
but
Jason
be
right
about
the
dynamics
on
gun
control
we
newspaper
the
Washington
Post
do
a
poll
right
after
San
Bernardino
and
find
that
53
%
of
the
public
oppose
a
assault
weapon
ban
which
be
the
highest
level
of
opposition
we
have
ever
see
in
the
poll
we
be
go
to
get
to
other
executive
action
like
do
not
mo
in
a
minute
I
want
to
bring
you
in
on
the
pressure
on
republican
leader
here
be
the
president
again
talk
about
executive
action
on
gun
to
kick
off
the
year
he
be
signal
more
executive
action
on
immigration
we
will
get
to
Gitmo
in
a
minute
we
have
hear
from
republican
leader
before
we
be
go
to
stop
he
we
be
go
to
stop
this
they
get
control
of
both
chamber
of
Congress
be
the
pressure
on
Paul
Ryan
as
a
new
speaker
to
finally
do
something
because
Mitch
McConnell
do
not
John
Boehner
do
not
you
have
get
to
ask
yourself
what
be
the
tool
that
Congress
have
if
you
come
into
office
as
Ryan
do
late
in
the
year
when
the
only
way
to
take
away
the
purse
string
be
to
defeat
or
withdrawal
continuing
resolution
the
funding
of
the
whole
government
so
you
fund
everything
or
you
fund
nothing
then
you
really
have
no
choice
what
I
be
hope
I
be
sure
what
Ryan
be
go
to
try
to
do
be
to
go
back
to
the
way
that
the
constitution
suggest
we
ought
to
have
the
power
of
the
purse
string
exercise
which
be
one
appropriation
bill
after
another
if
you
want
to
stop
a
specific
measure
you
do
it
in
a
circumscribed
way
over
that
measure
if
that
happen
then
I
think
there
will
be
a
lot
of
thing
that
can
potentially
be
stop
the
next
president
should
he
or
she
choose
to
can
overturn
the
executive
order
with
a
stroke
of
a
pen
you
have
get
to
win
the
White
House
that
be
true
I
think
what
this
do
it
take
each
one
of
these
issue
on
which
he
be
act
and
elevate
it
in
the
presidential
campaign
I
just
think
this
executive
action
route
underlie
the
weakness
of
the
president
as
a
leader
he
be
unable
to
build
a
consensus
or
build
coalition
resort
to
go
it
alone
and
in
a
representative
democracy
that
can
be
very
problematic
and
he
be
use
it
to
push
some
of
he
biggest
agenda
item
let
talk
about
one
of
the
agenda
item
you
have
get
the
president
at
he
year-end
news
conference
you
get
military
expert
say
hold
on
a
second
listen
by
early
next
year
we
should
have
reduce
that
population
below
100
and
we
will
continue
continue
to
steadily
chip
away
at
the
number
in
Guantanamo
they
be
go
to
release
17
in
the
month
of
January
if
you
figure
that
30
%
of
those
will
return
five
or
six
of
they
will
return
to
be
al
Qaeda
or
Taliban
or
Isil
leader
in
the
future
that
be
not
good
for
we
to
Jason
point
about
the
president
not
build
a
coalition
and
act
alone
you
have
have
republican
like
Colin
Powell
and
John
McCain
say
close
down
Guantanamo
Republicans
have
not
do
it
why
should
not
the
president
move
on
he
own
I
have
all
the
respect
in
the
world
for
John
McCain
and
Colin
Powell
but
it
be
a
terrible
idea
the
fact
woo
he
know
some
of
these
guy
who
be
go
to
end
up
kill
Americans
it
be
that
we
have
reduce
we
ability
to
interrogate
and
get
information
with
drone
strike
one
of
the
reason
we
have
interrogate
they
be
we
have
nowhere
for
they
to
go
once
you
bring
they
to
the
United
States
you
put
they
on
trial
they
acquire
all
kind
of
Miranda
rights
which
be
insane
in
the
middle
of
a
war
there
be
not
a
german
or
japanese
soldier
whoever
get
he
Miranda
rights
the
beauty
of
Guantanamo
be
that
it
have
a
status
the
issue
be
indefinite
tension
there
be
no
way
they
be
ever
go
to
release
Khalid
Sheikh
Mohammed
and
there
be
no
way
we
will
ever
be
able
to
successfully
try
he
you
need
Guantanamo
in
the
future
it
be
the
fact
that
we
need
intelligence
and
that
be
where
would
you
send
people
Guantanamo
week
one
of
he
administration
be
there
any
hope
of
a
consensus
no
and
I
think
also
more
difficult
politically
this
be
a
moment
in
which
he
leadership
on
national
security
issue
and
specifically
the
fight
against
Isis
be
come
under
a
lot
of
criticism
you
do
need
something
political
leverage
even
to
do
executive
order
how
the
president
mad
about
the
Isis
strategy
and
how
the
public
see
it
he
want
better
pr
he
want
a
strategy
to
clean
up
the
pr
do
that
make
sense
it
make
no
sense
I
think
Isis
be
ascendant
it
be
recruit
it
do
seem
to
be
striking
when
it
want
and
where
if
want
and
we
strategy
be
not
work
next
up
the
panel
fearless
prediction
for
2016
as
well
as
they
pick
for
what

we
need
to
take
we
country
back
2016
be
go
to
be
the
last
year
until
we
utterly
destroy
Isis
he
look
forward
to
2016
be
a
year
that
we
can
realize
as
a
nation
that
there
be
more
that
union
nate
we
than

we
2016
need
to
be
the
year
of
a
real
change
in
Washington
I
hope
we
have
a
prosper
prosperous
healthy
my
resolution
be
to
make
America
great
again
I
love
the
juxtaposition
here
Jeb
Bush
say
protion
parrot
and
DONALD
TRUMP
say
make
America
great
again
give
I
one
prediction
about
2016
my
prediction
be
that
the
Supreme
Court
be
go
to
strake
down
the
race
base
of
policy
they
seem
very
skeptical
during
oral
argument
and
I
think
the
day
be
number
for
race
bait
you
have
be
on
the
campaign
trail
what
do
you
think
of
Iowa
I
think
bar
weather
I
think
the
turnout
for
these
republican
Iowa
caucus
be
go
to
be
in
Donald
Trump
word
uge
and
it
be
the
trump
factor
both
people
will
be
show
up
to
vote
for
he
and
will
be
show
up
to
stop
he
there
will
be
a
lot
of
people
turn
out
Charles
we
be
go
to
get
to
you
suggest
resolution
in
a
minute
for
some
the
candidate
what
do
you
think
what
would
you
predict
about
the
Republican
party
in
the
road
ahead
I
think
there
be
a
reasonable
chance
perhaps
a
that
this
revolve
around
trump
if
he
either
win
the
nomination
or
if
he
he
and
he
follower
have
a
sense
that
they
be
deny
the
nomination
we
will
see
a
split
in
the
Republican
party
either
a
third
party
candidacy
or
massive
defection
like
Democrats
for
Nixon
in
1972
so
do
you
think
--
--
please
tell
I
broker
convention
if
it
be
it
would
be
open
there
be
no
broker
anymore
and
do
you
see
that
--
--
they
be
all
out
of
business
doomsday
for
republican
or
can
they
be
save
Yuan
Day
in
the
near
term
it
would
be
doomsday
you
have
get
some
suggest
new
year
resolution
for
some
the
candidate
I
for
Donald
Trump
to
give
treat
for
lentd
I
do
not
think
he
be
go
to
listen
to
that
something
he
could
but
he
ought
to
think
about
Grecian
formula
to
add
in
the
gray
he
need
a
lot
of
gray
for
Rubio
Bush
the
won
worder
tease
it
up
pray
and
in
fact
pray
a
lot
and
in
fact
I
would
use
so
be
100
million
he
raise
to
buy
indulgence
that
be
the
last
resort
Jason
can
prayer
work
at
this
point
for
Jeb
Bush
I
do
not
know
if
it
can
work
for
Jeb
Bush
I
do
think
all
the
Republican
however
need
to
realize
that
they
need
to
nominate
someone
who
can
win
more
republican
voter
win
in
swing
state
he
think
that
they
also
need
to
realize
the
sooner
they
decide
on
the
candidate
the
better
what
Hillary
Clinton
be
count
on
be
a
long
draw
out
process
a
candidate
that
be
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
and
take
a
lot
of
punch
before
she
face
they
we
hear
that
in
2008
it
be
long
and
draw
out
for
Barack
Obama
and
Hillary
Clinton
in
the
end
I
think
then
Senator
Obama
emerge
stronger
from
a
tough
primary
absolutely
as
a
result
of
that
he
have
organization
in
state
across
the
map
because
he
have
have
to
go
to
those
state
to
fight
Hillary
Clinton
he
would
do
a
little
fact
checking
because
last
year
at
this
time
I
be
fill
in
for
Bret
Baier
and
we
ask
for
personal
resolution
and
Charles
have
this
one
well
my
resolution
be
to
try
to
smile
this
year
I
be
shock
to
learn
that
people
actually
think
that
I
be
grim
and
dower
severe
and
here
be
to
2016
grin
and
tooth
I
think
have
you
be
show
tooth
we
crack
staff
put
together
some
photo
and
throughout
the
year
they
think
there
be
a
mix
do
you
think
that
you
mean
it
do
you
think
you
smile
more
this
year
no
I
miss
the
quote
attachment
I
need
to
go
a
long
way
I
work
on
it
I
practice
in
the
mirror
there
be
a
long
way
to
go
after
all
these
year
you
fall
out
of
practice
I
actually
do
give
a
speech
in
which
a
woman
come
up
to
I
at
the
end
and
say
I
be
glad
I
hear
new
person
because
in
tv
you
be
so
morose
and
dower
and
she
say
I
be
glad
to
know
you
have
tooth
that
be
where
that
come
from
do
you
have
any
more
suggest
resolution
for
candidate
for
for
some
the
candidate
Ted
Cruz
the
one
that
be
remain
be
for
Cruz
evidence
do
not
exactly
inspire
mirth
so
I
think
he
serious
one
be
to
win
Iowa
by
10
win
by
10
and
that
would
put
some
pressure
on
Donald
Trump
that
would
set
he
up
and
then
trump
will
be
tweet
a
lot
Jason
prediction
for
for
Iowa
I
see
Ted
Cruz
win
Iowa
and
I
would
--
and
I
think
Marco
Rubio
might
pull
it
out
in
New
Hampshire
really
yes
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
Donald
Trump
evidence
think
he
be
go
to
win
both
I
think
lose
Iowa
will
take
some
steam
out
of
he
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
he
in
New
Hampshire
I
think
Charles
smile
a
lot
and
I
be
expect
even
more
smile
in
2016
be
you
challenge
I
I
be
challenge
to
you
smile

be
actually
the
head
that
be
remove
from

a
intertwine
sheet
that
be
braid
together
it
be
about
11
foot
long
that
be
also
remove
from
the
cell
if
he
be
to

and
have
this
cover
up
and
a
body-like
object
in
the
cell
the

might
walk
by
especially
if
the
lighting
be
bad
in
the
cell
and
at
first
glass
look
through
the
cell
door
and
you
see
this
that

could
possibly
be
somebody
lay
there
when
actually

in
whose
cell
the
item
be
find
be

he
record
inside
prison
be
trouble

be
why

be
kind
of
hard
to
believe
the
head
be
not
as
big
of
a
concern
the
rope
be
what
be
concern
he
say
it
be

consequence
the
wrong
choice
trotter

pretty
massive
riot
that
they

time
and
Chris

of
the
main
player
in

overexaggerate
they

what
that
be
it
be
spontaneous
one
incident
lead
to
something
else
lead
to
something
else
lead
to
something
else
but
it
be
never
the
solution
Trotter
have
now
be
in
prison
for
26
year
73
due
to
he
role
in
the
riot
and
other
disciplinary
problem
he
have
spend
16
of
those
year
in
the
securitied
confinement
unit
due
to
he
behavior
in
the
past
trafficking
extortion
intimidation
we
consider
he
to
be
a
risk
to
we
safety
therefore
he
be
place
on
administrative
segregation
Trotter
have
spend
many
year
in
confinement
reading
and
writing
he
have
find
particular
meaning
in
Mary
Shelley
frankenstein
as
a
child
I
always
watch
the
movie
Frankenstein
so
I
recently
read
the
novel
I
be
like
hey
I
start
to
look
at
the
monster
kind
of
differently
I
be
like
who
be
really
the
monster
to
I
this
place
be
Frankenstein
and
we
be
the
monster
and
I
call
this
the
belly
of
the
beast
we
be
the
outcast
we
be
the
forget
all
right
in
my
spare
time
I
like
to
write
and
I
have
be
contemplate
on
write
a
book
I
start
off
like
this
Frankenstein
the
moment
you
create
I
you
condemn
I
reject
I
crucify
and
despise
I
abandon
I
emotionally
unleash
the
very
hell
in
I
often
overlook
step
upon
crushed
no
one
stop
to
notice
that
my
movement
be
poetic
my
stride
be
determine
my
love
be
unconditional
my
spirit
be
free
although
I
be
a
monster
there
be
a
soul
inside
of
I
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
employee
in
the
Indiana
Department
of
correction
in
any
state
facility
that
do
not
know
the
name
Christopher
Trotter
Beverly
Gilmore
be
the
confinement
unit
case
manager
one
of
she
responsibility
be
to
evaluate
trotter
ability
to
return
peacefully
to
general
population
I
know
the
notoriety
of
offender
trotter
very
notorious
I
believe
he
have
age
out
of
that
immaturity
he
have
develop
good
communication
skill
good
social
skill
it
be
yes
no
to
I
and
it
be
not
fake
I
can
always
tell
when
it
be
fake
I
believe
personally
that
he
will
be
ready
for
general
population
before
long
however
there
be
so
many
more
people
above
I
that
will
also
have
the
input
and
have
know
he
so
much
longer
than
I
have
so
I
will
have
to
respect
whatever
they
recommendation
will
be
I
would
rather
not
see
he
come
out
I
do
not
think
he
be
change
he
be
go
to
hurt
somebody
lieutenant
Gary
McMillan
have
be
at
Wabash
for
the
past
16
year
this
be
my
opinion
he
be
a
pretty
violent
individual
they
may
look
at
it
like
everybody
still
a
potential
threat
but
be
I
a
threat
no
come
up
--
really
my
biggest
concern
about
be
inside
be
just
get
in
trouble
fresh
from
Wabash
youth
unit
a
18-year-old
inmate
spend
he
first
day
in
the
big
house
I
use
to
be
a
very
violent
person
I
hope
no
one
try
testing
I
there
be
no
hard
labor
here
and
make
it
sort
of
hard
to
keep
yourself
in
shape
you
see
a
lot
of
guy
that
be
be
here
after
two
or
three
or
more
year
and
they
get
that
couch
potato
look
on
they
you
know
hang
gut
and
all
that
there
sag
everywhere
I
I
like
to
try
to
keep
myself
in
shape
at
Indiana
maximum
security
Wabash
Valley
Correctional
facility
most
inmate
work
out
either
on
the
outside
recreation
yard
or
inside
on
weight
machine
but
not
James
Stone
I
get
16
workout
I
do
in
here
use
the
bag
and
the
box
after
26
year
in
prison
stone
have
develop
a
workout
routine
he
can
do
inside
he
cell
water
bottle
all
water
bottle
get
it
close
be
the
problem
one
set
of
everything
every
day
until
I
burn
out
I
do
not
do
a
certain
amount
I
do
they
till
I
can
not
do
they
no
more
and
I
record
how
many
I
do
of
each
thing
each
day
then
the
next
day
my
goal
be
to
do
one
more
better
than
what
I
do
the
day
before
you
can
not
get
it
out
there
at
rec
there
be
too
many
people
out
there
in
that
little
closed
area
and
the
weight
out
there
be
not
real
weight
I
like
something
lifting
where
you
concentrate
on
the
weight
work
you
body
not
work
out
with
training
wheel
put
it
back
after
you
get
to
a
number
that
be
just
unbelievable
then
you
start
walk
around
wear
a
cape
because
you
be
like
superman
which
I
be
not
reach
that
level
yet
I
be
still
in
the
bat
cave
you
know
what
I
mean
Stone
who
be
convict
of
attempt
murder
will
not
be
eligible
for
parole
for
another
25
year
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
he
life
in

but
he
say
he
workout
be
design
to
prepare
he
just
in
case
he
be
release
rotate
around
like
I
be
work

workout
that
way
if
I
do
get
out

I
be
all
ready
for
it
plus
when
you
get
to
be
my

you
get
to
stay
in
shape
that
way
when
the
guy
half
my
age

be
like
that
even
Miss
Gilmore

not
calm
he
down
I
think

a
little
bit
of
a
mama
substitute

would
you
talk

kind
of
trouble
when
a
11-foot
rope
and
the
sculpture
of
a
head
be
discover
inside
he
cell
raise
concern
about
a
possible
escape
attempt
aderibigbe
say
the
item
be
only
for
exercise
and
recreation
after
further
review
internal
affair
investigator
Frank
Littlejohn
say
the
evidence
appear
to
support
aderibigbe
story
with
he
history
of
violence
that
be
land
he
not
only
in
prison
but
in
a
lockdown
unit
where
he
be
separate
from
the
population
because
of
he
assaultive
history
you
can
not
never
take
anything
that
appear
innocent
at
face
value
the

be
take
away
but
aderibigbe

this
be
coffee
with
soap

that
for
the
paint
for
all
the

I
have
be
make
so
far

good
when
I
be

Trotter
recently
file
a
request
to
be
transfer
from
confinement
back
to
general
population
where
he
would
have
considerably
more
freedom
five
six
seven
--
because
he
be
at
the
center
of
a
1985
riot
one
of
the
most
violent
incident
in
the
history
of
the
Indiana
state
prison
system
the
request
must
be
approve
by
multiple
level
of
administration
include
Wabash
superintendent
Dick
Brown
I
be
come
down
to
talk
to
Chris
Trotter
he
ask
to
be
release
from
departmentwide
administrative
segregation
so
I
be
come
down
to
speak
to
he
about
that
review
he
will
be
meet
with
the
team
manager
Jerry
Synder
casebook
manager
Beverly
Gilmore
and
myself
hello
hi
Sir
how
you
do
have
not
see
you
in
a
long
time
I
know
it
be
be
a
long
time
yeah
yeah
it
be
be
a
long
time
some
staff
have
recommend
you
be
release
from
departmentwide
administrative
segregation
some
staff
have
not
okay
so
with
that
be
say
it
be
now
in
my
hand
to
make
a
recommendation
to
central
office
though
trotter
have
show
improvement
one
of
the
first
thing
superintendent
brown
want
to
address
be
a
conduct
report
that
he
receive
several
month
earlier
Chris
Trotter
start
say
over
and
over
f
the
police
kill
the
police
that
sound
like
a
threat
to
I
no
but
that
be
not
it
at
all
that
be
not
it
we
be
work
out
together
on
the
range
and
we
have
we
chin
after
the
workout
and
he
take
it
out
of
context
and
nobody
say
kill
the
police
or
anything
like
that
I
be
not
in
here
for
kill
the
police
and
I
have
not
kill
the
police
you
know
and
he
just
take
it
out
of
context
and
it
be
basically
to
discourage
we
from
you
know
further
show
a
sign
of
unity
you
know
--
someone
approach
I
and
state
if
I
be
go
to
kill
I
--
if
I
be
the
correctional
officer
--
he
be
way
up
in
the
pod
I
be
way
in
cell
6
he
be
up
in
the
pod
how
can
he
determine
who
say
what
you
have
a
very
distinctive
voice
do
you
not
but
I
be
say
several
of
we
it
be
a
whole
range
of
people
holler
the
same
thing
let
I
say
this
to
you
in
1985
when
I
get
involve
in
that
prison
riot
I
do
not
regret
it
for
the
simple
fact
be
this
I
feel
that
I
be
do
the
right
thing
in
my
heart
of
heart
I
be
not
commit
a
crime
I
be
prevent
a
crime
but
be
I
remorseful
yes
for
the
simple
fact
be
people
get
hurt
not
just
staff
not
just
prisoner
but
family
so
I
be
remorseful
in
that
sense
and
what
do
I
do
about
it
I
have
not
involve
myself
in
anything
since
then
you
know
that
if
you
go
out
into
general
population
this
new
generation
be
go
to
want
to
challenge
the
infamous
Christopher
Trotter
how
in
the
world
be
you
go
to
deal
with
the
bunch
of
punks
come
up
challenge
you
first
off
stick
and
stone
may
break
my
bone
but
word
will
never
hurt
I
so
I
do
not
care
what
they
say
you
know
and
as
long
as
you
do
not
put
you
hand
on
I
we
all
right
I
have
not
have
no
situation
with
nobody
I
mean
nobody
none
the
only
situation
when
I
first
come
here
I
be
here
a
month
without
my
personal
property
and
I
deal
with
that
in
a
good
manner
you
deal
in
that
with
a
loud
manner
I
remember
well
I
get
a
tame
tongue
not
a
untame
tongue
seriously
you
think
highly
of
yourself
do
you
know
that
now
that
be
the
difference
though
I
would
really
like
to
be
able
to
see
Christopher
trotter
go
back
to
general
population
because
of
the
length
of
time
he
have
be
in
segregation
should
he
go
I
be
so
thankful
I
be
not
make
that
decision
bottom
line
be
here
where
be
we
be
at
it
be
up
to
I
to
make
the
recommendation
okay
like
I
say
some
staff
here
in
this
unit

recommend
you
by
release

have
not
I
like
to
know
who
have
not
no
you
be
not
allow
to
know
who
do
and
who
do
not
okay
the
important
thing
to
know
be
that

be
in
my
hand
now
okay
so
it
do
not
matter
what
the
other
staff
recommend
it
be
up
to
I
now
the
responsibility
be
at
my
level

you
time
and

conclude
the
question
yz
have
for
you
thanks
so
much
thank

about
11
foot
long
that
be
also
remove
from

have
this
cover
up
and
a
body-like
object
in
the
cell
the

might
walk
by
especially
if
the
lighting
be
bad
in
the
cell
and
at
first
glass
look
through
the
cell
door
and
you

this
that

could
possibly
be
somebody
lay
there
when

not
as
big
of
a
concern
the
rope
be
what
be
concern
he
say
it
be

I
do
not
know
what
the

I
down
I
try
not
sometimes

but
it
be
never
the
solution
Trotter
have
now
be
in
prison
for
26
year
73
due
to
he
role
in
the
riot
and
other
disciplinary
problem
he
have
spend
16
of
those
year
in
the
securitied
confinement
unit
due
to
he
behavior
in
the
past
trafficking
extortion
intimidation
we
consider
he
to
be
a
risk
to
we
safety
therefore
he
be
place
on
administrative
segregation
Trotter
have
spend
many
year
in
confinement
reading
and
writing
he
have
find
particular
meaning
in
Mary
Shelley
frankenstein
as
a
child
I
always
watch
the
movie
Frankenstein
so
I
recently
read
the
novel
I
be
like
hey
I
start
to
look
at
the
monster
kind
of
differently
I
be
like
who
be
really
the
monster
to
I
this
place
be
Frankenstein
and
we
be
the
monster
and
I
call
this
the
belly
of
the
beast
we
be
the
outcast
we
be
the
forget
all
right
in
my
spare
time
I
like
to
write
and
I
have
be
contemplate
on
write
a
book
I
start
off
like
this
Frankenstein
the
moment
you
create
I
you
condemn
I
reject
I
crucify
and
despise
I
abandon
I
emotionally
unleash
the
very
hell
in
I
often
overlook
step
upon
crushed
no
one
stop
to
notice
that
my
movement
be
poetic
my
stride
be
determine
my
love
be
unconditional
my
spirit
be
free
although
I
be
a
monster
there
be
a
soul
inside
of
I
I
do
not
believe
there
be
a
employee
in
the
Indiana
Department
of
correction
in
any
state
facility
that
do
not
know
the
name
Christopher
Trotter
Beverly
Gilmore
be
the
confinement
unit
case
manager
one
of
she
responsibility
be
to
evaluate
trotter
ability
to
return
peacefully
to
general
population
I
know
the
notoriety
of
offender
trotter
very
notorious
I
believe
he
have
age
out
of
that
immaturity
he
have
develop
good
communication
skill
good
social
skill
it
be
yes
no
to
I
and
it
be
not
fake
I
can
always
tell
when
it
be
fake
I
believe
personally
that
he
will
be
ready
for
general
population
before
long
however
there
be
so
many
more
people
above
I
that
will
also
have
the
input
and
have
know
he
so
much
longer
than
I
have
so
I
will
have
to
respect
whatever
they
recommendation
will
be
I
would
rather
not
see
he
come
out
I
do
not
think
he
be
change
he
be
go
to
hurt
somebody
lieutenant
Gary
McMillan
have
be
at
Wabash
for
the
past
16
year
this
be
my
opinion
he
be
a
pretty
violent
individual
they
may
look
at
it
like
everybody
still
a
potential
threat
but
be
I
a
threat
no
come
up
--
really
my
biggest
concern
about
be
inside
be
just
get
in
trouble
fresh
from
Wabash
youth
unit
a
18-year-old
inmate
spend
he
first
day
in
the
big
house
I
use
to
be
a
very
violent
person
I
hope
no
one
try
testing
I
there
be
no
hard
labor
here
and
make
it
sort
of
hard
to
keep
yourself
in
shape
you
see
a
lot
of
guy
that
be
be
here
after
two
or
three
or
more
year
and
they
get
that
couch
potato
look
on
they
you
know
hang
gut
and
all
that
there
sag
everywhere
I
I
like
to
try
to
keep
myself
in
shape
at
Indiana
maximum
security
Wabash
Valley
Correctional
facility
most
inmate
work
out
either
on
the
outside
recreation
yard
or
inside
on
weight
machine
but
not
James
Stone
I
get
16
workout
I
do
in
here
use
the
bag
and
the
box
after
26
year
in
prison
stone
have
develop
a
workout
routine
he
can
do
inside
he
cell
water
bottle
all
water
bottle
get
it
close
be
the
problem
one
set
of
everything
every
day
until
I
burn
out
I
do
not
do
a
certain
amount
I
do
they
till
I
can
not
do
they
no
more
and
I
record
how
many
I
do
of
each
thing
each
day
then
the
next
day
my
goal
be
to
do
one
more
better
than
what
I
do
the
day
before
you
can
not
get
it
out
there
at
rec
there
be
too
many
people
out
there
in
that
little
closed
area
and
the
weight
out
there
be
not
real
weight
I
like
something
lifting
where
you
concentrate
on
the
weight
work
you
body
not
work
out
with
training
wheel
put
it
back
after
you
get
to
a
number
that
be
just
unbelievable
then
you
start
walk
around
wear
a
cape
because
you
be
like
superman
which
I
be
not
reach
that
level
yet
I
be
still
in
the
bat
cave
you
know
what
I
mean
Stone
who
be
convict
of
attempt
murder
will
not
be
eligible
for
parole
for
another
25
year
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
he
life
in
prison
but
he
say
he
workout
be
design
to
prepare
he
just
in
case
he
be
release
rotate
around
like
I
be
work
on
a
load
dock
or
something
call
it
a
worker
workout
that
way
if
I
do
get
out
job
be
not
go
to
kill
I
I
be
all
ready
for
it
plus
when
you
get
to
be
my
age
you
get
to
stay
in
shape
that
way
when
the
guy
half
my
age
want
to
mess
with
the
old
man
it
be
not
my
fault
there
be
always
a
new
guy
or
two
arrive
on
stone

I
come
from

so
protected
and
so
green
when
I
come
here
and
when
I
start
learn
more
about
the

of

I
think
why
can
not
I
be
a
advocate
for
they
on
a
daily
basis
they
will
send
letter
to
I
or
note
request
information
maybe
complain
or
some
of
they
just
tell
I
have
a
nice
day
Miss
Gilmore
and
that
be
nice
because
it
be
better
than
get
cuss
out
one
of
Gilmore
inmate
be
lukuman
aderibigbe
what
be
go
on
with
you
man
I
will
say
hey
Lukuman
be
you
okay
mon
and
he
will
go
oh
Miss
Gilmore
you
okay
mon
I
enjoy
that
kind
of
talk
with
he
when
I
can
understand
he
he
get
to
talk
fast
and
I
say
slow
it
down
buddy
but
despite
Gilmore
best
effort
aderibigbe
have
be
a
challenge
for
correction
staff
he
act
out
have
just
be
extreme
such
as
maybe
he
do
not
get
a
apple
in
he
lunch
or
a
officer
or
anybody
will
be
glad
to
go
get
the
apple
and
take
it
to
he
but
he
would
react
to
that
by
bang
and
bang
and
throw
thing
to
the
point
where
the
response
team
would
have
to
go
in
and
take
he
to
the
ground
he
be
a
strong
little
dude
too
he
will
throw
stuff
he
will
smear
poop
fece
he
be
do
a
little
bit
of
everything
when
he
be
like
that
even
Miss
Gilmore
here
can
not
calm
he
down
I
think
maybe
I
be
a
little
bit
of
a
mama
substitute
to
he
and
I
can
usually
say
now
would
you
talk
to
you
mama
that
way
and
it
usually
you
know
help
he
aderibigbe
recently
find
himself
in
a
different
kind
of
trouble
when
a
11-foot
rope
and
the
sculpture
of
a
head
be
discover
inside
he
cell
raise
concern
about
a
possible
escape
attempt
aderibigbe
say
the
item
be
only
for
exercise
and
recreation
after
further
review
internal
affair
investigator
Frank
Littlejohn
say
the
evidence
appear
to
support
aderibigbe
story
with
he
history
of
violence
that
be
land
he
not
only
in
prison
but
in
a
lockdown
unit
where
he
be
separate
from
the
population
because
of
he
assaultive
history
you
can
not
never
take
anything
that
appear
innocent
at
face
value
the
rope
be
take
away
but
aderibigbe
be
give
permission

Trotter
recently
file
a
request
to
be
transfer
from
confinement
back
to
general
population
where
he
would
have
considerably
more
freedom
five
six
seven
--
because
he
be
at
the
center
of
a
1985
riot
one
of
the
most
violent
incident
in
the
history
of
the
Indiana
state
prison
system
the
request
must
be
approve
by
multiple
level
of
administration
include
Wabash
superintendent
Dick
Brown
I
be
come
down
to
talk
to
Chris
Trotter
he
ask
to
be
release
from
departmentwide
administrative
segregation
so
I
be
come
down
to
speak
to
he
about
that
review
he
will
be
meet
with
the
team
manager
Jerry
Synder
casebook
manager
Beverly
Gilmore
and
myself
hello
hi
Sir
how
you
do
have
not
see
you
in
a
long
time
I
know
it
be
be
a
long
time
yeah
yeah
it
be
be
a
long
time
some
staff
have
recommend
you
be
release
from
departmentwide
administrative
segregation
some
staff
have
not
okay
so
with
that
be
say
it
be
now
in
my
hand
to
make
a
recommendation
to
central
office
though
trotter
have
show
improvement
one
of
the
first
thing
superintendent
brown
want
to
address
be
a
conduct
report
that
he
receive
several
month
earlier
Chris
Trotter
start
say
over
and
over
f
the
police
kill
the
police
that
sound
like
a
threat
to
I
no
but
that
be
not
it
at
all
that
be
not
it
we
be
work
out
together
on
the
range
and
we
have
we
chin
after
the
workout
and
he
take
it
out
of
context
and
nobody
say
kill
the
police
or
anything
like
that
I
be
not
in
here
for
kill
the
police
and
I
have
not
kill
the
police
you
know
and
he
just
take
it
out
of
context
and
it
be
basically
to
discourage
we
from
you
know
further
show
a
sign
of
unity
you
know
--
someone
approach
I
and
state
if
I
be
go
to
kill
I
--
if
I
be
the
correctional
officer
--
he
be
way
up
in
the
pod
I
be
way
in
cell
6
he
be
up
in
the
pod
how
can
he
determine
who
say
what
you
have
a
very
distinctive
voice
do
you
not
but
I
be
say
several
of
we
it
be
a
whole
range
of
people
holler
the
same
thing
let
I
say
this
to
you
in
1985
when
I
get
involve
in
that
prison
riot
I
do
not
regret
it
for
the
simple
fact
be
this
I
feel
that
I
be
do
the
right
thing
in
my
heart
of
heart
I
be
not
commit
a
crime
I
be
prevent
a
crime
but
be
I
remorseful
yes
for
the
simple
fact
be
people
get
hurt
not
just
staff
not
just
prisoner
but
family
so
I
be
remorseful
in
that
sense
and
what
do
I
do
about
it
I
have
not
involve
myself
in
anything
since
then
you
know
that
if
you
go
out
into
general
population
this
new
generation
be
go
to
want
to
challenge
the
infamous
Christopher
Trotter
how
in
the
world
be
you
go
to
deal
with
the
bunch
of
punks
come
up
challenge
you
first
off
stick
and
stone
may
break
my
bone
but
word
will
never
hurt
I
so
I
do
not
care
what
they
say
you
know
and
as
long
as
you
do
not
put
you
hand
on
I
we
all
right
I
have
not
have
no
situation
with
nobody
I
mean
nobody
none
the
only
situation
when
I
first
come
here
I
be
here
a
month
without
my
personal
property
and
I
deal
with
that
in
a
good
manner
you
deal
in
that
with
a
loud
manner
I
remember
well
I
get
a
tame
tongue
not
a
untame
tongue
seriously
you
think
highly
of
yourself
do
you
know
that
now
that
be
the
difference
though
I
would
really
like
to
be
able
to
see
Christopher
trotter
go
back
to
general
population
because
of
the
length
of
time
he
have
be
in
segregation
should
he
go
I
be
so
thankful
I
be
not
make
that
decision
bottom
line
be
here
where
be
we
be
at
it
be
up
to
I
to
make
the
recommendation
okay
like
I
say
some
staff
here
in
this
unit

recommend
you

not
I
like
to
know
who
have
not
no
you
be
not
allow
to
know
who
do
and
who
do
not
okay
the
important
thing
to
know
be
that

in
my
hand
now
okay
so

do
not
matter
what

other
staff

be
up
to
I
now

responsibility
be
at
my
level

the
question

have
for
you

so
much

-lsb-

-rsb-
a
lot
I
be
not
say
I
be
a
saint
I
be
far
from
a
saint
that
be
probably
why
I
be
still
alive
today
I
should
have
be
dead
several
time
long
time
ago
but
evidently
heaven
do
not
want
I
and
hell
afraid
I
be
go
to
take
over
so
I
be
pretty
well
stick
here
on
this
planet
but
stone
have
not
completely
resign
himself
to
life
at
Wabash
Valley
he
be
request
a
transfer
back
to
the
prison
where
he
use
to
be
house
Indiana
state
I
know
they
do
not
have
no
problem
move
I
out
I
do
not
know
why
it
should
be
a
big
problem
move
I
back
up
there
now
Stone
motivation
for
the
transfer
be
to
reunite
with
he
cat
jinkster
when
I
do
feel
like
I
be
about
ready
to
go
do
something
stupid
you
look
at
those
big
Betty
Davis
eye
and
you
think
hey
this
guy
depend
on
I
I
have
get
to
take
care
of
he
Stone
receive
jinkster
as
part
of
the

program
at

have
to
leave
he
behind
when
he
be
transfer
to
wabash
for
the
first
several
week

live
with
another
inmate
but
then
jinkster
move
out
to
the
country
he
be
adopt
by
Stone
parent
jinkster
be
something
else
he
be
not
use
to
carpeting
and
cloth
furniture
everything
be
claw
I
mean
he
claw
up
carpet
everything
else
but
it
be
worth
it
because
it
be
JIM

people
might
not
quite
understand
it
but
my
family
we
view
we
pet
as
family
member

he
love
to
go
for
these
walk
and
we
would
go
for
a

out
and
I
would
put
he
on
my
shoulder
and
bring
he
on
in
I
be
69
year
old
and
my
worst
fear
be
I
will
never
get
to
walk
through
the
wood
with
he
Jim
would
love
it
out
here
he
be
such
a

of
the
reason
we
get
this
place

be
everything
that
he
would
want
we
all
miss
he

every
day
there

part

the
answer
be
know

whether
story
consider

60
degree
right
now
we
have
snow
on
the
power
of

radar
network

here
in
Cleveland
and
Mansfield
we
may
bottom
out

be

a
good

dear
good

Betsy
have
some
idea
I
think
we
could
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
that
would
be
awesome
that
would
be
good
definitely
we
have
see
some
lake
effect
throughout
the
afternoon
but
it
be
really
fizzle
quickly
this
evening
we
will
continue
to
have
flurry
around
and
yes
even
some
additional
minor
accumulation
out
into
probably
far
northern
lake
county
out
around
boy
Madison
on
the
lake
probably
see
some
of
those
very
minor
accumulation
still
to
come
farther
south
it
be
just
cloudy
and
it
be
cold
temperature
be
in
the
20s
but
the
windchill
be
in
the
low
and
mid-teens
across
northern
Ohio
that
be
go
to
be
the
story
as
you
step
out
the
door
in
the
morning
and
I
think
more
the
most
part
the
big
picture
show
the
cold
air
be
here
obviously
now
that
it
be
January
1st
but
we
be
not
the
only
one
deal
with
this
New
Orleans
be
40
degree
40
in
Birmingham
Alabama
the
really
nasty
cold
air
be
bank
up
against
Hudson
Bay
that
will
be
move
south
we
way
as
we
head
into
Sunday
and
into
Monday
a
rude
awakening
as
we
get
into
work
Lake
chance
remain
east
as
we
start
the
day
tomorrow
temp
--
temperature
in
the
20s
as
we
head
through
the
day
tomorrow
I
think
temperature
will
be
top
out
right
around
freezing
if
we
do
not
hit
33
degree
I
really
think
that
yesterday
morning
33
at
will
end
up
be
the
last
time
we
be
above
freezing
all
the
way
into
Wednesday
but
the
good
news
be
maybe
we
will
get
there
to
about
33
degree
we
will
hopefully
see
a
little
bit
of
sunshine
as
we
head
through
the
day
tomorrow
but
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
cold
more
cloud
and
snow
beyond
that
the
flurry
chance
remain
east
in
the
morning
tomorrow
I
think
we
will
be
right
around
that
freezing
mark
and
temperature
Sunday
will
start
around
freezing
and
slowly
slide
as
we
head
through
the
afternoon
much
of
the
day
we
will
spend
in
the
20s
and
then
Monday
we
be
not
go
to
make
it
out
of
the
mid-20
it
be
go
to
be
a
cold
start
to
that
school
week
unfortunately
for
the
kid
head
back
out
the
door
window
nation
seven
day
forecast
take
a
nice
turn
after
that
then
we
will
start
to
warm
up
we
will
see
brighter
sky
so
all
hope
be
not
lose
but
it
look
like
beyond
next
Friday
we
start
to
get
into
a
pattern
that
stay
a
little
on
the
cold
side
and
every
now
and
then
we
will
see
a
little
bit
of
snow
all
right
thanks
betsy
what
do
you
